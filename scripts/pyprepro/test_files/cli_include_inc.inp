This is part of the include test. None of these variables should be printed and
they should all be define as Immutable.

There should also be no difference between any kind of block

{include_var1 = 1.1}
{include_var2 = include_var1 + 1}

% include_var3 = 'include var 3 in code line'

{%
    include_var4 = 'include 4 code block'
%}

{param = 10}
