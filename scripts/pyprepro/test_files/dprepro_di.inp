This template makes use of the DakotaParams and DakotaResults objects
that are made availble for substitution when the dakota.interfacing
module is present.

First, here's the string variable ddssv_1, printed using the 
DakotaParams object: {DakotaParams["ddssv_1"]}

And, without: {ddssv_1}.

The DakotaParams object provides access to variables by their original
names, even when they were clobbered by pyprepro.

For example, x:y is not a valid Python identifer, but it can be
accessed using DakotaParams["x:y"]: {DakotaParams["x:y"]}.

This variable is available with a mangled name, too, as x_y: {x_y}

Ditto for várïåbłę (in Python 2): {DakotaParams["várïåbłę"]}

The "metadata" for the evaluation that are stored in these objects
are also available:

* The evaluation ID: {DakotaParams.eval_id}
* The ASV for the functions:
  o Function: {DakotaResults["response_fn_1"].asv.function}
  o Gradient: {DakotaResults["response_fn_1"].asv.gradient}
  o Hessian:  {DakotaResults["response_fn_1"].asv.hessian}
