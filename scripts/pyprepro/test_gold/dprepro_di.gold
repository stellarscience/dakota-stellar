This template makes use of the DakotaParams and DakotaResults objects
that are made availble for substitution when the dakota.interfacing
module is present.

First, here's the string variable ddssv_1, printed using the 
DakotaParams object: double  space

And, without: double  space.

The DakotaParams object provides access to variables by their original
names, even when they were clobbered by pyprepro.

For example, x:y is not a valid Python identifer, but it can be
accessed using DakotaParams["x:y"]: 0.2152421414.

This variable is available with a mangled name, too, as x_y: 0.2152421414

Ditto for várïåbłę (in Python 2): 5.36064852

The "metadata" for the evaluation that are stored in these objects
are also available:

* The evaluation ID: 1
* The ASV for the functions:
  o Function: True
  o Gradient: False
  o Hessian:  False
