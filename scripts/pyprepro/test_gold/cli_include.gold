Test IMMEDIATELY setting a var
param = 10 # 10 from include

Test that these vars got includes
include_var1: 1.1
include_var2: 2.1
include_var3: include var 3 in code line
include_var4: include 4 code block

Make sure they are, in fact immutable: (if they are, it would read 1,2,3,4)
include_var1 = 1 : 1.1
include_var2 = 2 : 2.1
include_var3 = 3 : include var 3 in code line
include_var4 = 4 : include 4 code block

Override immutability of include_var1
include_var1 = Mutable(include_var1) : 1.1
include_var1 = 10: 10 # Should read 10

from cli
cparam: 10; cparam = 4: 10
