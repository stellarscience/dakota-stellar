    ''' <summary>
    ''' The main class through which JEGA is used from within VB.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' 
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' This class provides the functionality necessary to run JEGA given
    ''' instructions as to how it is to be run.  Those instructions are
    ''' provided using the MProblemConfig and MAlgorithmConfig objects of the
    ''' Managed JEGA front end project.  They may be provided directly or
    ''' implementations of the VBJEGAProblemConfigLoader and
    ''' VBJEGAAlgorithmConfigLoader may be provided in their stead
    ''' respectively.
    ''' 
    ''' Prior to attempting any JEGA runs, you must initialize the library with
    ''' a call to <code>VBJEGADriver.InitializeJEGA</code>.  This should get
    ''' called once and only once.  Once that is done, the Driver can be used
    ''' in a number of ways and multiple Drivers can be operating
    ''' simultaneously (from multiple threads if JEGA was compiled with thread
    ''' awareness).  The most common way to use it is to create one with a
    ''' MProblemConfig or VBJEGAProblemConfigLoader as the constructor argument
    ''' in the usual VB syntax.  For example:
    ''' <code>
    '''      Dim probConfig As New MProblemConfig()
    '''      probConfig.Add...
    '''      :
    '''      :
    '''      Dim driver As New VBJEGADriver(probConfig)
    ''' </code>
    ''' or
    ''' <code>
    '''      Dim probConfigLoader As New MyProbConfigLoader()
    '''      Dim driver As New VBJEGADriver(probConfigLoader)
    ''' </code>
    ''' Where MyProbConfigLoader is a class of your creation that implements
    ''' the VBJEGAProblemConfigLoader interface.  In this second case, the
    ''' VBJEGADriver constructor will create a new MProblemConfig and load
    ''' it by calling
    ''' <code>probConfigLoader.LoadConfiguration(newConfig)</code>.
    ''' 
    ''' Once the driver is created and the problem configuration is loaded, the
    ''' driver can them be used to solve problems with calls to Run.  This can
    ''' be done in one of two ways.  The first is to call the overload taking a
    ''' fully loaded MAlgorithmConfig.  The second is to call the overload
    ''' taking an MEvaluationFunctor and a VBJEGAAlgorithmConfigLoader.  For
    ''' example:
    ''' <code>
    '''      Dim evalFunctor As New MyEvalFunctor()
    '''      Dim algConfig As New MAlgorithmConfig( _
    '''           VBJEGADriver.GetEvaluator(evalFunctor) _
    '''           )
    '''      algConfig.Add...
    '''      :
    '''      :
    '''      Dim results As SolutionVector = driver.Run(algConfig)
    ''' </code>
    ''' or
    ''' <code>
    '''      Dim functor As New MyEvalFunctor()
    '''      Dim algConfigLoader as new MyAlgConfigLoader()
    '''      Dim results As SolutionVector = _
    '''          driver.Run(functor, algConfigLoader)
    ''' </code>
    ''' Where MyEvalFunctor is a class of your creation that implements the
    ''' MEvaluationFunctor interface and MyAlgConfigLoader is a class of your
    ''' creation that implements the VBJEGAAlgorithmConfigLoader interface.  In
    ''' this second case, the VBJEGADriver run method will create the
    ''' MAlgorithmConfig object needed and load it by calling
    ''' <code>algConfigLoader.LoadConfiguration(newConfig)</code>.  It will
    ''' also create the necessary evaluator object from the supplied functor
    ''' which must be done explicitly if using the first example.
    '''
    ''' You could use the driver to solve the same problem using multiple
    ''' algorithm configurations by repeating the above code over and over.  In
    ''' the second case, you would have to supply multiple algorithm
    ''' configuration loaders or create ways to change the existing one, etc.
