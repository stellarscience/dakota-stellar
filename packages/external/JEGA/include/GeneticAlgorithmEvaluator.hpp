/// The base class for all GeneticAlgorithm evaluators.
/**
 * The evaluators is responsible for retrieving proper objective function and
 * constraint values for Designs.  It can do it however it sees fit.
 *
 * This base class provides a means of tracking the number of evaluations
 * executed.  It also requires of it's derivatives implementation of the
 * Evaluate method.  All overriding implementations of the Evaluate(Design)
 * method must call back to this base classes version after evaluation has
 * finished.
 *
 * The maximum allowable number of evaluations is extracted from the parameter
 * database using the name "method.max_function_evaluations".  It is extracted
 * as a size_type parameter.  Note that this is a parameter shared with the
 * genetic algorithm converger operator.  If it is not in the parameter
 * database, the default value as defined by DEFAULT_MAX_EVALS will be used.
 * This is required in addition to any requirements of the base class.
