/// A class for grouping of GeneticAlgorithmOperators
/**
 * This is the base class for groups of compatible GeneticAlgorithm operators.
 * Each group has registries associated with each type of operator.  Only
 * operators that can be used in conjunction with one another should be put into
 * the same group. For example, if you wish to devise a custom crossover scheme
 * that is intimately tied to a custom mutation scheme such that other mutation
 * schemes will cause incorrect behavior, then the two custom schemes should
 * appear as the only operators in their respective group registries (crosser
 * and mutator in this case).
 *
 * In addition to implementing the pure functions in this class, the following
 * requirements hold:
 *
 * All derived classes must implement each of the methods shown below.
 * They should be cut and pasted from below as is without modification
 * into the section entitled "Public Methods".
 * \code

    static
    GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry&
    MutatorRegistry()
    {
        static GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry registry;
        return registry;
    }

    static
    GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry&
    ConvergerRegistry()
    {
        static GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry registry;
        return registry;
    }

    static
    GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry&
    CrosserRegistry()
    {
        static GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry registry;
        return registry;
    }

    static
    GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry&
    NichePressureApplicatorRegistry()
    {
        static GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry registry;
        return registry;
    }

    static
    GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry&
    FitnessAssessorRegistry()
    {
        static GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry registry;
        return registry;
    }

    static
    GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry&
    SelectorRegistry()
    {
        static GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry registry;
        return registry;
    }

    static
    GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry&
    PostProcessorRegistry()
    {
        static GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry registry;
        return registry;
    }

    static
    GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry&
    InitializerRegistry()
    {
        static GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry registry;
        return registry;
    }

    static
    GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry&
    EvaluatorRegistry()
    {
        static GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry registry;
        return registry;
    }

    static
    GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry&
    MainLoopRegistry()
    {
        static GeneticAlgorithmOperatorRegistry registry;
        return registry;
    }
    \endcode
 * These static methods should be called and returned from the virtual "Get"
 * methods associated with them.  The "Get" methods need not (and should not)
 * do anything else.
 *
 * All derived types must provide a static method that returns a unique name
 * for the operator group.  The method would look something like this:
 * \code

    static
    const std::string&
    Name()
    {
        static const std::string ret("Operator Group Name Here");
        return ret;
    };

   \endcode
 * This static method should be called and returned from the GetName method.
 * The GetName method need not (and should not) do anything else.
 *
 * Finally, registration of the desired operators and absorption of the desired
 * operator groups should take place in the constructor.  This can be done by
 * writing a static method in each derived class that will perform the
 * necessary operations.  It is recommended that you use a static Boolean
 * within the class to prevent re-acquisition (which will not hurt anything, it
 * will just be wasted effort).
