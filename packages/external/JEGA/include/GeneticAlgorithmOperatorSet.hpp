 * They include (in no particular order) a GeneticAlgorithm:
 *
 * Mutator
 * Crosser
 * Converger
 * Initializer
 * Selector
 * MainLoop
 * Evaluator
 * PostProcessor
 * FitnessAssessor
 * NichePressureApplicator
 *
 * Each instance of an operator set maintains a collection of default operators
 * that cannot be changed.  All the defaults are instances of the Null version
 * of the associated operator.  The set is considered to contain the default
 * operator if and only if the currently held operator is the exact same
 * instance as the default operator.  Being the same type means nothing.
 *
 * This object does not "own" the operators within it although it does offer
 * method that can be used to destroy them.  Do not directly destroy an
 * operator obtained from an operator set as it may be a default operator
 * and thus should not be deleted external to this class.  Instead use
 * the methods provided to destroy the operators which will account for the
 * possibility of having default operators.
 *
 * If you do delete an operator external to a set containing it, be sure to set
 * the operator appropriately either to another new operator or to null in
 * which case the default version will be used.
