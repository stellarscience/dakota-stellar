/// The base class for all genetic algorithms.
/**
 * This base class provides most of the needed functionality of a genetic
 * algorithm.  Only a small number of methods must be overridden and they
 * generally require little code.
 *
 * The algorithm is conceptually separate from the operators used to implement
 * it.  The operators are therefore "pluggable" and could in theory be changed
 * at any time.  This class keeps track of what operators are currently in
 * use by containing a GeneticAlgorithmOperatorSet as a member data.  In order
 * to ensure that the operators in use are compatible with one another, this
 * class also keeps a current operator group.  The operator group is
 * automatically chosen from all groups registered with this algorithm as
 * obtained from a call the required override GetOperatorGroupRegistry.
 * The first operator group that contains all the operators in the current
 * operator set is used as the current group.  If none are found then an
 * error occurs.
