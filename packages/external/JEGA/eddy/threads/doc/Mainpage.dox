 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * This application provides for multi-threaded programming including
 * manipulation of threads, mutexes, and conditions.
 *
 * \section purpose Purpose
 *
 * The purpose of this application is to provide a simple OO interface to
 * multi-threaded application development.  It is meant to be portable
 * and thus is not very feature rich.
 *
 * \section impl Implementation
 *
 * This project is modeled heavily after the thread library of the boost
 * project but does not make use of it.  The main classes of this project are
 * - thread
 * - mutex
 * - mutex_lock
 * - condition
 * - mutexed_variable
 *
 * In addition, there are some thread safe versions of miscellaneous
 * classes such as containers.  The underlying thread manipulation library
 * is pthreads which are available for *nix OS flavors as well as for windows.
 *
 * \section usage Usage
 *
 * To use this module, add the include directory to your list of include
 * directories and link to the appropriate library which is one of:
 *
 * (In Windows)
 * - /lib/libethreads.lib (for release builds)
 * - /lib/libethreads_d.lib (for debug builds)
 *
 * (In *nix)
 * - lib/libethreads.a
 *
 * \section future Future Work
 *
 * The ThreadPool class is not yet functional.  Plan to finish or eliminate
 * it in the future.
