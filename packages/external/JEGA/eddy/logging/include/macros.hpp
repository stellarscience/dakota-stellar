/// A macro to execute a method on an object of non-pointer type.
/**
 * This macro is intended to aid in calling various functions on a log_gateway
 * but could be used on anything.  It expands to a call on \a tlg of \a method
 * using params if EDDY_LOGGING_ON is defined.  Otherwise it expands to
 * nothing.
 *
 * If \a method requires a template list of more than one argument, use the
 * EDDY_LOGGING_TPL macro to create the list.  The parameters must be
 * surrounded by parenthesis and therefore require no special treatment
 * (can have a comma separated list).
 *
 * Using this macro will cause the line:
 * \code
        EDDY_LOGGING_ON_LOG(mylog, set_default_level, (level_p::L1));
 * \endcode
 * to become:
 * \code
        mylog.set_default_level(level_p::L1);
   \endcode
 *
 * Note that to execute the log_gateway::log methods, you should use the
 * EDDY_LOGGING_LOG* macros as they can be much more efficient for that
 * purpose.
 *
 * \param tlg The object on which to execute \a method using params.
 * \param method The method to execute on \a tlg using params.
 * \param params The parenthesized, comma-separated list of \a method
 *               arguments.
