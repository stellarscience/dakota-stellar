/**
 * \brief Converges a MOGA based on observations of the evolution of the
 *        non-dominated frontier.
 *
 * This converger tracks three metrics in an attempt to determine when the
 * non-dominated frontier stops changing.  When each of the three metrics
 * have stopped changing by a minimum of the supplied percent change over
 * the supplied number of generations, the algorithm stops.
 *
 * The three metrics are as follows:
 * <OL>
 *      <LI>Maximum percentage change in range along any objective dimension.
 *      <LI>Percentage change in density of frontier.
 *      <LI>Percentage of previous population dominated by current population.
 * </OL>
 *
 * The expansion metric is computed by tracking the extremes of the
 * non-dominated frontier from one generation to the next.  Any movement of
 * the extreme values is noticed and the maximum percentage movement is
 * computed as:
 * \verbatim
    Em = max over j of abs((range(j,i) - range(j,i-1)) / range(j,i-1)) j=1,nof
   \endverbatim
 * where Em is the max expansion metric, j is the objective function index,
 * i is the current generation number, and nof is the total number of
 * objectives.  The range is the difference between the largest value along
 * an objective and the smallest when considering only non-dominated designs.
 *
 * The density metric is computed as the number of non-dominated points
 * divided by the hypervolume of the non-dominated region of space.  Therefore,
 * changes in the density can be caused by changes in the number of
 * non-dominated points or by changes in size of the non-dominated space or
 * both.  The size of the non-dominated space is computed as:
 * \verbatim
    Vps(i) = product over j of range(j,i)   j=1,nof
   \endverbatim
 * where Vps(i) is the hypervolume of the non-dominated space at generation i
 * and all other terms have the same meanings as above.
 *
 * The density of the a given non-dominated space is then:
 * \verbatim
    Dps(i) = Pct(i) / Vps(i)
   \endverbatim
 * where Pct(i) is the number of points on the non-dominated frontier at
 * generation i.
 *
 * The percentage increase in density of the frontier is then calculated as
 * \verbatim
    Cd = abs((Dps(i) - Dps(i-1)) / Dps(i-1))
   \endverbatim
 * where Cd is the change in density metric.
 *
 * The final metric is computed by considering each design in the previous
 * population and determining if it is dominated by any designs in the
 * current population.  All that are determined to be dominated are counted.
 * The metric is the ratio of the number that are dominated to the total number
 * that exist in the previous population.
 *
 * Each of these metrics is a percentage.  The tracker records the largest of
 * these three at each generation.  Once the recorded percentage is below the
 * supplied percent change for the supplied number of generations
 * consecutively, the algorithm is converged.
 *
 * This operator requires only the configuration inputs of the base class.
