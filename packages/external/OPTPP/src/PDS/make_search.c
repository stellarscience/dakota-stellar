   * THIS IS A CONTROLLING ROUTINE TO CONSTRUCT AN ACTUAL SEARCH

   *
   * THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS SEARCH STRATEGY IS DISCUSSED ON
   * PP. 459-462 AND PP. 463-466; THE ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTED BELOW IS
   * FORMALLY STATED IN TABLE 3, P. 465.

   *
   * LAST MODIFICATION:  MARCH 11, 1992.

   *       SCHEME        A WORK VECTOR PASSED FROM THE MAIN PROGRAM
   *                     THAT IS REPARTITIONED INTO A MATRIX WITH ROWS
   *                     FROM -1 TO N AND AS MANY COLUMNS AS THE
   *                     ORIGINAL DIMENSION OF THE VECTOR WILL ALLOW.
   *                     THIS ARRAY IS USED TO HOLD THE N-TUPLES (IN
   *                     ROWS 1 THROUGH N) FOR EVERY POINT GENERATED
   *                     AS A POSSIBLE POINT IN THE SEARCH STRATEGY.
   *                     IN ROWS -1 AND 0 ARE THE SCALAR `A' AND THE
   *                     POINT `BEST' NECESSARY TO RECONSTRUCT THE

   *                     N-TUPLES IN SCHEME (IF AN N-TUPLE OCCURS MORE

   *       FACTOR        THE SCALING FACTOR USED TO GENERATE THE LIST;
   *                     `FACTOR' IS CHOSEN TO ALLOW ALL THE WORK TO
   *                     BE DONE IN INTEGER ARITHMETIC BOTH TO SAVE

   *       ERROR         ERROR FLAG TO SIGNAL WHETHER OR NOT PREMATURE
   *                     TERMINATION OCCURRED.  IF `ERROR' IS SET TO
   *                     ZERO, THEN NO ERRORS HAVE BEEN FLAGGED.
   *                     CURRENTLY, THE ONLY ERROR FLAGGED IS WHEN THE
   *                     QUICKSORT ROUTINES RETURN BECAUSE THE LENGTH
   *                     OF THE ARRAY PASSED TO SORT EXCEEDS THE
   *                     CAPACITY OF THE INTERNAL STACK.  FOR FURTHER
   *                     INFORMATION ON THIS ERROR, SEE THE COMMENTS
   *                     IN THE ROUTINES `SORT' AND `QUICK'.
   *
   * LOCAL CONSTANTS
   *
   *    THE PARAMETERS ALPHA, BETA, AND GAMMA SET THE SIZE OF THE *
   *    REFLECTION, CONTRACTION, AND EXPANSION STEPS, RESPECTIVELY.  *
   *    THESE CONSTANTS ARE CURRENTLY SET TO THE DEFAULT VALUES *
   *    RECOMMENDED BY NELDER AND MEAD (NOTE THAT WE DIVIDE BY BETA!).
   *    * THE ALGORITHM BELOW ASSUMES THAT EACH CONSTANT IS A POWER OF
   *    TWO * SO THAT THE WORK CAN BE DONE IN INTEGER ARITHMETIC.  THE
   *    CRITICAL * "PIECES" OF THE SEARCH SCHEME RESIDE IN THE DATA
   *    STRUCTURE * `SCHEME'.  THE MATRIX `SCHEME' CAN BE THOUGHT OF
   *    AS TWO VECTORS, * `A', WHICH IS STORED IN THE -1 ROW OF
   *    `SCHEME', AND `BEST', WHICH * IS STORED IN THE 0 ROW OF
   *    `SCHEME', AND ONE MATRIX `NTUPLES', * WHICH IS STORED IN THE
   *    REMAINING ROWS OF `SCHEME'.  THE PURPOSE * OF THESE PIECES ARE
   *    AS FOLLOWS:
   *
   *       A        AN INTEGER ARRAY WHICH CONTAINS THE SCALAR NECESSARY
   *                TO RECONSTRUCT THE SIMPLEX ASSOCIATED WITH A GIVEN
   *                POINT I
   *
   *       BEST     AN INTEGER ARRAY WHICH CONTAINS THE POINTER TO THE
   *                VERTEX IN THE ORIGINAL SIMPLEX ASSOCIATED WITH A
   *                GIVEN POINT I
   *
   *       NTUPLES  AN INTEGER MATRIX WHICH CONTAINS THE SCALARS
   *                NECESSARY TO CONSTRUCT POINT I FROM THE N EDGES
   *                ADJACENT TO THE BEST VERTEX IN THE ORIGINAL SIMPLEX;
   *                THE N-TUPLES ARE STORED BY COLUMN
   *
   *    NOTE THAT FOR ALL THREE STRUCTURES WE ALSO KEEP INFORMATION
   *    ABOUT * THE N+1 VERTICES IN THE ORIGINAL SIMPLEX IN
   *    POSITIONS/COLUMNS -N * THROUGH 0 SO THAT WE HAVE ALL THE
   *    INFORMATION WE NEED BOTH TO * GENERATE THE NEW POINTS AND TO
   *    DETECT DUPLICATION.
   *
   * INITIALIZE THE OPTIMIZATION PROCEDURE BY DETERMINING THE POINTS
   * TO BE COMPUTED AT EACH ITERATION ON THE HYPERCUBE.
   *
   * THERE IS AN UPPER LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF POINTS WE CAN CONSIDER
   * WHICH IS BASED ON THE DIMENSION OF THE PROBLEM `N' AND THE SIZE
   * OF `SCHEME'.  CALCULATE THAT LIMIT.
   *
   * WE WILL ALSO RESCALE BY THE "GREATEST COMMON DENOMINATOR"
   * (DETERMINED BY `BETA').  IN ESSENCE, WE ARE TRYING TO GUESS HOW
   * MANY "LOOK-AHEADS" WE MUST DO TO FILL OUT THE "RAW" LIST OF
   * POINTS WE WILL GENERATE.  THE SIZE OF THE RAW LIST IS DETERMINED
   * BY `LIMIT' (I.E., THE MAXIMUM SIZE OF `SCHEME').  ONCE WE RESCALE
   * ACCORDINGLY, WE CAN WORK STRICTLY IN INTEGER ARITHMETIC.
