/** \page example2 Example 2: Nonlinear Interior-Point Method With General Constraints

This example is intended to demonstrate how to set up and solve a
problem with general constraints and analytic derivative information.
In particular, this example is Hock and Schittkowski problem number
65, i.e.

<em> minimize </em> 
\f[ (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (1/9)(x_1 + x_2 - 10)^2 + (x_3 - 5)^2 \f]
<em> subject to </em> \f[ x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 \le 48, \f]
<em> </em>  \f[-4.5 \le x_1 \le 4.5, \f]
<em> </em>  \f[-4.5 \le x_2 \le 4.5, \f]
<em> </em>  \f[ -5.0 \le x_3 \le 5.0 \f]

Hock and Schittkowski problem number 65 has bound constraints 
and nonlinear constraints. In addition, analytic
gradient and Hessian information is available for both the objective
function and the nonlinear constraints.  We opted to use a nonlinear
interior-point method to solve this problem. 

Recall that it is necessary to write C++ code for the main routine
that sets up the problem and the algorithm and for the subroutines
that initialize and evaluate the function and the constraints.  We
step through the specifics below.

<ul>
  <li> \ref main2 <br>
  <li> \ref function2 <br>
  <li> \ref run2 <br>
</ul>

\section main2 Main Routine

First include the necessary header files.  Start with any C++/C header
files that are needed.  In this case, none are necessary.  The two
header files are OPT++ header files.  NLF contains objects, data, and
methods required for setting up the function/problem.  The next three
header files contain objects, data, and methods required for the
constraints.  OptNIPS contains the objects, data, and methods required
for using the nonlinear interior-point optimization method.  The last four 
statements correspond to the use of namespaces. The
<tt> using NEWMAT::ColumnVector</tt> statement imports the data member 
\a ColumnVector from the matrix library namespace NEWMAT.  The use of namespaces 
prevents potential conflicts with third party libraries that may also have a data
members named \a ColumnVector, \a Matrix, and \a SymmetricMatrix. The last 
statement allows you to access methods and data members in the OPTPP namespace.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
#include "NLF.h"
#include "BoundConstraint.h"
#include "NonLinearInequality.h"
#include "CompoundConstraint.h"
#include "OptNIPS.h"

using NEWMAT::ColumnVector;
using NEWMAT::Matrix;
using NEWMAT::SymmetricMatrix;

using namespace OPTPP;
\endcode
</table>

The first two lines serve as the declarations of the pointers to the
subroutines that initialize the problem and evaluate the objective
function, respectively.  The third line is the pointer to the
subroutine that evaluates the nonlinear constraints.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
void init_hs65(int ndim, ColumnVector& x);
void hs65(int mode, int ndim, const ColumnVector& x, double& fx, 
          ColumnVector& gx, SymmetricMatrix& Hx, int& result);
void ineq_hs65(int mode, int ndim, const ColumnVector& x,
	       ColumnVector& cx, Matrix& cgx,
               OptppArray<SymmetricMatrix>& cHx, int& result);
\endcode
</table>

The first thing to do is set up the constraint object.  This is broken
down into several phases.  First, set the dimension of the problem and
allocate the space for the upper and lower bounds.  Assign the values
of the bounds, and create a Constraint object to hold all of the bound
constraints.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
int main ()
{
  int ndim = 3;
  ColumnVector lower(ndim), upper(ndim); 

// Here is one way to assign values to a ColumnVector.

  lower << -4.5 << -4.5 << -5.0;
  upper <<  4.5 <<  4.5 <<  5.0 ;

  Constraint c1 = new BoundConstraint(ndim, lower, upper);
\endcode
</table>

Nonlinear constraints are similar in nature to the objective function.
As such they are created in a similar manner.  Since analytic first
and second derivatives for the nonlinear constraints are available, an
NLF2 is constructed.  The calling sequence includes the dimension of
the problem, the number of nonlinear constraints, the pointer to the
subroutine that performs the constraint evaluation, and the pointer to
the subroutine that initializes the problem.  Then a Constraint object
is created to hold all of the nonlinear constraints.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
  NLP* chs65 = new NLP(new NLF2(ndim, 1, ineq_hs65, init_hs65));
  Constraint nleqn = new NonLinearInequality(chs65);
\endcode
</table>

Once the constraint sets for each particular type of constraint have
been created, it is time to roll them all into one object.  That is
easily accomplished by the following line.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
  CompoundConstraint* constraints = new CompoundConstraint(nleqn, c1);
\endcode
</table>

The next few lines complete the setup of the problem.  Create the
nonlinear function object using the dimension of the problem, the
pointers to the subroutines declared above, and the
CompoundConstraint object.  The NLF2 object is used since analytic
gradient and Hessian are available.  

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
  NLF2 nips(ndim, hs65, init_hs65, constraints);
\endcode
</table>
  
Build a nonlinear interior-point algorithm object using the nonlinear
problem that has just been created.  In addition, set any of the
algorithmic parameters to desired values.  All parameters have default
values, so it is not necessary to set them unless you have specific
values you wish to use.  In this example, we set the name of the
output file, the function tolerance (used as a stopping criterion),
the maximum number iterations allowed, and the merit function to be
used.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
  OptNIPS objfcn(&nips);

// The "0" in the second argument says to create a new file.  A "1"
// would signify appending to an existing file.

  objfcn.setOutputFile("example2.out", 0);
  objfcn.setFcnTol(1.0e-06);
  objfcn.setMaxIter(150);
  objfcn.setMeritFcn(ArgaezTapia);
\endcode
</table>

Now call the algorithm's optimize method to solve the problem.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
  objfcn.optimize();
\endcode
</table>

Print out some summary information and clean up before exiting.  The
summary information is handy, but not necessary.  The cleanup flushes
the I/O buffers.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
  objfcn.printStatus("Solution from nips");
  objfcn.cleanup();
}
\endcode
</table>

Now that the main routine is in place, we step through the code
required for the initialization and evaluation of the function.

\section function2 User-Defined Functions

This section contains examples of the user-defined functions that are
required.  The first performs the initialization of the problem.  The
second performs the evaluation of the function.  The last performs the
evaluation of the nonlinear constraints.

First, include the necessary header files.  In this case, we need the
OPT++ header file, NLP, for some definitions. We also need to list which
items we are using from the NEWMAT namespace.  We recommend this approach 
as opposed <tt>using namespace NEWMAT </tt> to reduce the potential for
naming conflicts.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
#include "NLP.h"
using NEWMAT::ColumnVector;
using NEWMAT::Matrix;
using NEWMAT::SymmetricMatrix;
\endcode
</table>

The subroutine that initializes the problem should perform any
one-time tasks that are needed for the problem.  One part of that is
checking for error conditions in the setup.  In this case, the
dimension, \a ndim, can only take on a value of 3.  Using "exit"
is not the ideal way to deal with error conditions, but it serves well
as an example.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
void init_hs65(int ndim, ColumnVector& x)
{
  if (ndim != 3)
    exit (1);

  double factor = 0.0;
\endcode
</table>

The initialization is also an ideal place to set the initial values of
the optimization parameters, \a x.  This can be hard coded, as
done here, or it can be done in some other manner (e.g., reading them
in from a file, the code for which should appear here).

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
// ColumnVectors are indexed from 1, and they use parentheses around
// the index.

  x(1) = -5.0  - (factor - 1)*8.6505;
  x(2) =  5.0  + (factor - 1)*1.3495;
  x(3) =  0.0  - (factor - 1)*4.6204;
}
\endcode
</table>

The next piece of code is a subroutine that will evaluate the
function.  In this problem, we are trying to find the minimum value of
Hock and Schittkowski problem 65, so it is necessary to write the code
that computes the value of that function given some set of optimization
parameters.  Mathematically, that function is:

\f[f(x) = (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (1/9)(x_1 + x_2 - 10)^2 + (x_3 - 5)^2 \f]

The following code will compute the value of \a f(x).

First, some error checking and manipulation of the optimization
parameters, \a x, are done.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
void hs65(int mode, int ndim, const ColumnVector& x, double& fx, ColumnVector& gx, SymmetricMatrix& Hx, int& result)
{
  double f1, f2, f3, x1, x2, x3;

  if (ndim != 3)
     exit(1);

  x1 = x(1);
  x2 = x(2);
  x3 = x(3);
  f1 = x1 - x2;
  f2 = x1 + x2 - 10.0;
  f3 = x3 - 5.0;
\endcode
</table>

If a function evaluation is requested, then the function value,
\a fx, is computed, and the \a result variable is set to
indicate that a function evaluation has been done.
  
<table>
<tr><td>
\code
  if (mode & NLPFunction) {
    fx  = f1*f1+ (f2*f2)/9.0 +f3*f3;
    result = NLPFunction;
  }
\endcode
</table>

If a gradient evaluation is requested, then the gradient, \a gx,
is computed, and the \a result variable is set to indicate that
a gradient evaluation has been done.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
  if (mode & NLPGradient) {
    gx(1) =  2*f1 + (2.0/9.0)*f2;
    gx(2) = -2*f1 + (2.0/9.0)*f2;
    gx(3) =  2*f3;
    result = NLPGradient;
  }
\endcode
</table>

If a Hessian evaluation is requested, then the Hessian, \a Hx,
is computed, and the \a result variable is set to indicate that
a Hessian evaluation has been done.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
// The various Matrix objects have two indices, are indexed from 1,
// and they use parentheses around // the index.

  if (mode & NLPHessian) {
    Hx(1,1) =  2 + (2.0/9.0);

    Hx(2,1) = -2 + (2.0/9.0);
    Hx(2,2) =  2 + (2.0/9.0);

    Hx(3,1) = 0.0;
    Hx(3,2) =  0.0;
    Hx(3,3) =  2.0;
    result = NLPHessian;
  }
}
\endcode
</table>

In a similar manner, the function, gradient, and Hessian values for
the nonlinear constraints must be computed.  For this problem, the
nonlinear constraint is the following:

\f[c(x) = 48 - x_1^2 - x_2^2 - x_3^2 \f]

The code for computing the function, gradient, and Hessian for this
constraint appears below.  The step-by-step breakdown is almost
exactly the same as it is for the function evaluation, so we do not go
through it here.

<table>
<tr><td>
\code
void ineq_hs65(int mode, int ndim, const ColumnVector& x, ColumnVector& cx, Matrix& cgx, OptppArray<SymmetricMatrix>& cHx, int& result)
{ // Hock and Schittkowski's Problem 65 
  double f1, f2, f3, x1, x2, x3;
  SymmetricMatrix Htmp(ndim);

  if (ndim != 3)
     exit(1);

  x1 = x(1);
  x2 = x(2);
  x3 = x(3);
  f1 = x1;
  f2 = x2;
  f3 = x3;

  if (mode & NLPFunction) {
    cx(1)  = 48 - f1*f1 - f2*f2 - f3*f3;
    result = NLPFunction;
  }
  if (mode & NLPGradient) {
    cgx(1,1) = -2*x1;
    cgx(2,1) = -2*x2;
    cgx(3,1) = -2*x3;
    result = NLPGradient;
  }
  if (mode & NLPHessian) {
    Htmp(1,1) = -2;
    Htmp(1,2) = 0.0;
    Htmp(1,3) = 0.0;
    Htmp(2,1) = 0.0;
    Htmp(2,2) = -2;
    Htmp(2,3) = 0.0;
    Htmp(3,1) = 0.0;
    Htmp(3,2) = 0.0;
    Htmp(3,3) = -2;

    cHx[0] = Htmp;
    result = NLPHessian;
  }
}
\endcode
</table>

On a more general note, these subroutines could serve as wrappers to C
or Fortran subroutines.  Similarly, it could make a system call to a
completely independent executable.  As long as the values of
<em>fx</em> and <em>result</em> are set when all is said and done, it
does not matter how the function value is computed.

Now that we have all of the code necessary to set up and solve this
Hock and Schittkowski function, give it a try!

\section run2 Building and Running the Example

If you want to try running this example, the following steps should do
the trick.

<ol>
      <li> Determine which defines you need.  If the C++ compiler you
	   are using supports the ANSI standard style of C header
	   files, you will need
           \verbatim
		-DHAVE_STD
           \endverbatim
	   If you are using the parallel version of OPT++, you will
	   need
           \verbatim
		-DWITH_MPI
           \endverbatim
      <li> Determine the location of the header files.  If you did a
	   "make install", they will be located in the "include"
	   subdirectory of the directory in which OPT++ is installed.
	   If that directory is not one your compiler normally checks,
	   you will need
           \verbatim
		-IOPT++_install_directory/include
           \endverbatim
	   If you did not do a "make install", the header files will
	   almost certainly be in a directory not checked by your
	   compiler.  Thus, you will need
           \verbatim
		-IOPT++_top_directory/include -IOPT++_top_directory/newmat11
           \endverbatim
	<li> Determine the location of the libraries.  If you did a
	   "make install", they will be located in the "lib"
	   subdirectory of the directory in which OPT++ is installed.
	   If that directory is not one your compiler normally checks,
	   you will need
           \verbatim
		-LOPT++_install_directory/lib
           \endverbatim
	   If you did not do a "make install", the libraries will
	   almost certainly be in a directory not checked by your
	   compiler.  Thus, you will need
           \verbatim
		-LOPT++_top_directory/lib/.libs
           \endverbatim
	<li> If you configured OPT++ for the default behavior of using
	   the BLAS and/or you configure OPT++ to use NPSOL, you will
	   need the appropriate Fortran libraries for linking.  The
	   easiest way to get these is to look in the Makefile for the
	   value of FLIBS.
	<li> If all is right in the world, the following format for your
	   compilation command should work:
           \verbatim
		$CXX <defines> <includes> example2.C tstfcn.C <lib \
		directory> -lopt -lnewmat -l$BLAS_LIB $FLIBS 
           \endverbatim
	   $CXX is the C++ compiler you are using.  <defines> and
	   <includes> are the flags determined in steps 1-2.  example2.C
	   is your main routine, and tstfcn.C contains your function
	   evaluations.  (Note: If you have put them both in one file,
	   you need only list that single file here.)  <lib_directory
	   was determined in step 3.  -lopt and -lnewmat are the two
	   OPT++ libraries.  $BLAS_LIB is the BLAS library you are
	   using, and $FLIBS is the list of Fortran libraries
	   determined in step 4.
</ol>

You should now be able to run the executable (type "./example2").  You
can compare the results, found in example2.out, to <a
href="example2_out.html">our results</a>.  There may be slight
differences due to operating system, compiler, etc., but the results
should very nearly match.
