The project TribitsExampleProject defines a TriBITS CMake project designed to
provide a simple example to demonstrate how to use the TriBITS system to
create a CMake build, test, and deployment system using a package-based
architecture.

To get started building you can create a directory structure like:

    ~/TribitsExampleProject.base/
        TribitsExampleProject/   # This directory
        BUILDS/
            GCC-<X.Y.Z>/
                SERIAL_DEBUG/

You can then copy the configure file as:

  cd ~/TribitsExampleProject.base/BUILDS/GCC-<X.Y.Z>/BUILDS/SERIAL_DEBUG
  cp ../../../../TribitsExampleProject/sampleScripts/linux-serial-debug.sh \
    do-configure

After that set, configure with:

  ./do-configure -DTribitsExProj_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES=ON

and then build and test with:

  make -j4 && ctest -j4

The layout of a TriBITS project is described in:

  https://tribits.org/doc/TribitsDevelopersGuide.html#tribits-project-structure

Otherwise, this example TriBITS project is simple enough that it should be
enough to get started as a template.
