# DAKOTA INPUT FILE - dakota_princ_comp.in
# This input file demonstates an initial prototype 
# principal components analysis (PCA).  In this version, 
# we take an initial LHS sample, typically of field 
# responses.  The sample matrix is decomposed using PCA
# and the first M components that contribute to 95% or 
# percent_variance_explained are retained and used in prediction.
# Setting debug output will result in all of the PCA 
# information being printed.
