# DP-497: Test calibration with fields, data, and nonlinear constraints

# The data are generated with 0.25, 0.25 such that it oscillates +, -,
# +, -, +, but is < 0 at last data point t_n. We calibrate with
# constraints that t_{n-1} > 0, t_n = 0

# Noise added for 3 experiments with constant coeff of variation noise
# d_noisy = (1+0.1*np.random.randn(3,20)) * d

# Test 1: Enables scaling to protect against bugs seen with constraint
# retrieval. Nonlinear constraints aren't scaled as that was case for bug.
