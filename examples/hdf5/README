The examples in this folder demonstrate use of Dakota's HDF5 output. They
contain:

* The Dakota input file that was used to produce the output for the example,
  (extension .in),
* The resulting Dakota HDF5 output file (extension h5),
* A Jupyter Notebook (http://jupyter.org/) that can be used for live 
  interaction with the example (extension ipynb),
* A Python script generated by exporting the notebook that can be run if a user
  does not have Jupyter (extention py), and
* An HTML file that contains a static view of the notebook (html),

Jupyter can be obtained from the URL above, or by installing a package such
as Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/) or Canopy 
(https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/). (An advantage of Anaconda and
Canopy is that they come "batteries included" with many popular third-party
Python modules, including h5py, numpy, and matplotib, which are needed
to run these examples.)

Users are encouraged to consult the Dakota HDF5 Output section of the Dakota
Reference Manual for a more detailed discussion of Dakota's output 
capabilities.
