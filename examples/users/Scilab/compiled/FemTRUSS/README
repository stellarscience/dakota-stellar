The Scilab/FemTRUSS example depends on the Scilab femtruss package.
To install this package, you can proceed in one of two ways:

  1. Start "Application -> Package manager ATOMS" which will open a
     GUI that will allow you to install the package. Click on "all
     modules" and then click on "install"

  2. You can do this manually:
     * atomsInstall('femtruss') // To install the femtruss package
       (this package is composed only of scilab scripts). The package
       will be loaded after the next startup of scilab.

     * atomsLoad('femtruss') // To load the package just after
       installation without having to restart scilab, enter this
       command

To check that the package has been installed: 
 * atomsIsInstalled('femtruss') // returns %T if the package is installed.
 * atomsIsLoaded('femtruss')    // returns %T if the package is loaded.
