*** This examples/README largely been superseded by README.md
*** corresponding to the new Examples Library. A few legacy example
*** directories that remain in top-level dakota/examples are still
*** documented here.

The directory Dakota/examples is designed to help users get started
using Dakota. The remaining legacy examples are grouped into the
following directories:

examples/users: Examples found in the Dakota User's Manual. The
examples in the Tutorial chapter demonstrate application of various
Dakota methods to simple analytic functions via both direct and
system/fork interfaces to simulators. More in-depth examples of
performing specific studies with various Dakota methods, including
uncertainty quantification, least squares (calibration), and
optimization appear throughout the manual. Also advanced examples such
as optimization under uncertainty, second-order probability, and
surrogate-based optimization.

examples/advanced: Examples used in Advanced Topics training.

examples/parallelism: A range of Dakota + application parallelism
examples from massively serial (embarrassingly parallel) to parallel
evaluations of a parallel analysis code.

examples/platforms: Platform-specific guidance for getting started
with Dakota, including potentially helpful compilation and run-time
options.
