Design variables are adjusted in the course of seeking an optimal
design or an optimal set of deterministic calibration parameters.

Continuous design variables, which may assume any real value within
specified bounds, are the most common design variable type in
engineering applications.  All but a handful of the optimization
algorithms in %Dakota support continuous design variables exclusively.
