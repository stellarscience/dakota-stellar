The CONMIN library \cite Van78 is a public domain library of nonlinear
programming optimizers, specifically the Fletcher-Reeves conjugate
gradient (\ref method-conmin_frcg) method for unconstrained
optimization, and the method of feasible directions (\ref
method-conmin_mfd) for constrained optimization. As CONMIN was a
predecessor to the DOT commercial library, the algorithm controls are
very similar.
