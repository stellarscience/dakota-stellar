Deactivate Dakota interface features for simplicity or efficiency

Description::
The optional \c deactivate specification block allows a user to
deactivate interface features in order to simplify interface
development, increase execution speed, and/or reduce memory and disk
requirements.  Any or all of these features may be specified
concurrently.

\li Active set vector (ASV) control: deactivate so that Dakota expects
    the same response data (all functions, gradients, Hessian) back
    from the simulation on every evaluation, instead of only those
    components required by the method for this particular function
    evaluation.

\li Function evaluation cache: save memory by not caching the function
    evaluation history.  May result in additional (duplicate) function
    evaluations.

\li Strict cache equality: allow a relaxed tolerance when detecting
    duplicate function evaluations.  Can be useful when importing data
    or restarting across machines.

\li Restart file: improve efficiency and eliminate restart file
    storage at the risk of not being able to recover a failed or
    partial %Dakota study.
