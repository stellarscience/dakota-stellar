Blurb:: Multiplier to scale prior variance

Description::
The initial proposal covariance will be given by the prior variance
times the multiplier.

<b> Default Behavior </b>
When using prior-based proposal covariance, the default is to use the
prior variance for the proposal (multiplier = 1.0)

<b> Usage Tips </b>

The prior variance may result in too tight or narrow a proposal
covariance. The multiplier can be used to scale all entries of the
prior variance in determining the initial proposal covariance.
