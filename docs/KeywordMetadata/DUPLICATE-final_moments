Output moments of the specified type and include them within the set of final statistics.

Description::
When performing a nested study that may employ moment statistics on the inner loop, it can be desirable to control the type of these moments.  The \c final_moments specification supports options of \c none, \c standard (default), or \c central, corresponding to omission of moments, standardized moments (mean, standard deviation, skewness, and excess kurtosis), or central moments (mean, variance, 3rd central, and 4th central).

The presence or omission of moment results in the final statistics influences the outer level mappings in the case of a nested study.  For example, \c final_moments \c none can allow for a more compact specification of primary and/or secondary response mappings.

Examples::

The following method specification overrides the default to print \c central moments and include them in the set of final statistics.
\verbatim
method,
  sampling
    samples = 50 seed = 1234
    response_levels = 3.6e+11 1.2e+05 3.5e+05
    final_moments central
\endverbatim

Overriding the default to \c none as follows:
\verbatim
method,
  sampling
    samples = 50 seed = 1234
    response_levels = 3.6e+11 1.2e+05 3.5e+05
    final_moments none
\endverbatim

allows associated nested model mappings to be simplified from:
\verbatim
model
  nested
    sub_method_pointer = 'UQ'
    primary_response_mapping   = 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.
    secondary_response_mapping = 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.
\endverbatim

to a more compact version focused only on the response level mappings (two 
leading zeros per response function for moment mappings have been removed):
\verbatim
model
  nested
    sub_method_pointer = 'UQ'
    primary_response_mapping   = 1. 1. 0.
    secondary_response_mapping = 0. 0. 1.
\endverbatim
