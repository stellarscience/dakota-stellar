Cause Dakota to step toward the failed "target" simulation from a nearby 
successful "source"
Description::

When \c failure_capture \c continuation is enabled and an evaluation fails, 
then Dakota will attempt to march incrementally from a previous good evaluation 
(the "source") toward the failing one (the "target"). Further details about the
algorithm employed by Dakota are supplied in the User's Manual 
\cite UsersMan.
