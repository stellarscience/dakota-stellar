Blurb:: MPP search for local reliability based on QMEA multi-point approximation in u-space

Description::

Local reliability methods that search for the most probable point
of failure (MPP) may use a surrogate-based optimization procedure.
The \c x_multi_point surrogate option creates a QMEA approximation
in the original random variable space ("x-space") from accumulating
data from multiple expansion points.

This capability is \b experimental.
