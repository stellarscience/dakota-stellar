Blurb::Estimate spectral coefficient decay rates to guide dimension-adaptive refinement.

Description::Estimate spectral coefficient decay rates from a rate estimation technique similar to Richardson extrapolation.  These decay rates are used to guide dimension-adaptive refinement, where slower decay rates result in higher dimension preference.
