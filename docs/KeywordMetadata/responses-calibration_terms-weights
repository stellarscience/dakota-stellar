Blurb::
Specify weights for each objective function

Description:: 
Specifies relative emphasis through weights (multipliers) w on
residual elements: \f[ f = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i R_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n}
w_i (y^{Model}_i - y^{Data}_i)^2 \f]

Length: The \c weights must have length equal to \ref
responses-calibration_terms. Thus, when scalar and/or field responses
are specified, the number of \c weights must equal the number of
scalars plus the number of fields, \e not the total elements in the
fields.

<b>Default Behavior</b> If weights are not specified, then each
residual is given equal weighting.

<b>Usage Tips:</b>

Weights are applied as multipliers, scales as charateristic values /
divisors.

When scaling is active, it is applied to calibration terms after any
residual formation (accounting for experimental data and optionally
measurement error covariance), and before any weights. See the
equations in \ref responses-calibration_terms.
