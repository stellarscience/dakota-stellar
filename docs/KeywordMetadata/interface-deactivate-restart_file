Blurb::
Deactivate writing to the restart file

Description::
Eliminate the output of each new function evaluation to the binary
restart file. This can increase speed and reduce disk storage
requirements, but at the expense of a loss in the ability to recover
and continue a run that terminates prematurely (e.g., due to a system
crash or network problem).

<b>Usage Tips</b>

\li This option is not recommended when function evaluations are
    costly or prone to failure.

\li Using the \c deactivate \c restart_file specification will result
    in a zero length restart file with the default name \c dakota.rst.
