Blurb:: Write evaluation data only for simulation interfaces to HDF5

Description::

When this option is selected, evaluation data only for simulation interfaces 
will be written to HDF5. Simulation interfaces include fork, system, direct, 
matlab, python, scilab, and grid interfaces, but not approximation interfaces,
which are automatically generated by Dakota to be used by surrogate models.

HDF5 output is an experimental feature, and the contents and organization of 
the output file is subject to change. The current organization and a
brief explanation of HDF5 is provided in the \ref hdf5_output section
of this manual.

Topics:: dakota_output

Examples::

For the example input in the parent keyword, the following interface groups would be 
written:

- \c /interfaces/truth/truth_m/

Depending on the \ref environment-results_output-hdf5-model_selection, the following links 
may be added to model \c sources groups.

- \c /models/simulation/truth_m/sources/truth \f$ \rightarrow \f$ \c /interfaces/truth/truth_m/
