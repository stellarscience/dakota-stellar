Importance sampling option for probability refinement
Description::
\c mm_adapt_import starts with all of the samples located in the failure region 
to build a multimodal sampling density. First, it uses a small number of samples around 
each of the initial samples in the failure region. Note that these samples 
are allocated to the different points based on their relative probabilities of occurrence:
more probable points get more samples. This early part of the approach is done 
to search for "representative" points. Once these are located, the multimodal sampling 
density is set and then \c mm_adapt_import proceeds similarly to \c adapt_import (sample 
until convergence).
