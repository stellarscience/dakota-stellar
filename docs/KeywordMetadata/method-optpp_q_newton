Quasi-Newton optimization method
Description::
This is a Newton method that expects a gradient and computes a
low-rank approximation to the Hessian.  Each of the Newton-based
methods are automatically bound to the appropriate OPT++ algorithm
based on the user constraint specification (unconstrained,
bound-constrained, or generally-constrained). In the
generally-constrained case, the Newton methods use a nonlinear
interior-point approach to manage the constraints.

See \ref topic-package_optpp for info related to all \c optpp methods.

<b>Expected HDF5 Output</b> 

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the 
\ref environment-results_output-hdf5 keyword, this method 
writes the following results to HDF5: 

- \ref hdf5_results-best_params 
- \ref hdf5_results-best_obj_fncs (when \ref responses-objective_functions) are specified) 
- \ref hdf5_results-best_constraints 
- \ref hdf5_results-calibration (when \ref responses-calibration_terms are specified)
