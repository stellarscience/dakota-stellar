Blurb::
Third-party optimization library integration demonstration.

Description::
This is not a method that is intended for use.  Rather it is part of a
documented, functional example of how to integrate a third-party
optimization library.  It takes an initial point, generates a list of
random parameter values, evaluates the function at each point in the
list, and returns the point with the lowest function value.

Documented instructions on how to integrate a third-party library,
working source code, and build infrastructure can be found in
$dakotaSource/packages/external/demo_tpl.  Additionally, integration
instructions can be found in the Developers Manual.
