Whether to minimize or maximize each objective function

Description::
The \c sense keyword is used to declare whether each objective function
should be minimized or maximized.  The argument options are:
\li \c "minimization" (can be abbreviated to "min")
\li \c "maximization" (can be abbreviated to "max")

If a single string is specified it will apply to each objective
function.  Otherwise, the number of strings should either be equal to
the number of objective functions (\ref
responses-objective_functions). Thus, when scalar and/or field
responses are specified, the number of \c sense strings must equal the
number of scalars plus the number of fields, \e not the total elements
in the fields.
