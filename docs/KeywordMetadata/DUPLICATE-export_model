Exports surrogate model in user-specified format(s)

Description::
Export the surrogate for later re-import to Dakota or evaluation using
the surfpack exectuable (\c bin/surfpack) or a user-developed
tool. Export format is controlled using the \c formats
specification. Four formats are available in %Dakota; however, not all
have been enabled for all surrogates.

The four formats are:
<ul> 
 <li>\c text_archive - Plain-text, machine-readable archive for re-import
  or use with the surfpack executable</li>
 <li>\c binary_archive - Binary, machine-readable archive for re-import or
  use with the surfpack executable</li>
 <li>\c algebraic_file - Plain-text, human-readable file intended for use with 
  user-created tools; not compatible with %Dakota or the surfpack executable</li>
 <li>\c algebraic_console - Print the model in algebraic format to the 
  screen; not compatible with %Dakota or the surfpack executable</li>
</ul>

These global surrogates can be exported in all four formats:
<ul>
 <li> Gaussian process (keyword \c gaussian_process surfpack)</li>
 <li> Artificial neural network (keyword \c neural_network)</li>
 <li> Radial basis Funtions (keyword \c radial_basis)</li>
 <li> Polynomial (keyword \c polynomial)</li>
</ul>

However, for experimental Gaussian Process and polynomial models as
well as Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (keyword \c mars) and
moving least squares (keyword \c moving_least_squares) models, only \c
text_archive and \c binary_archive formats may be used.

Currently, no other surrogate models can be exported.

<b> Default Behavior </b>
<p>No export.

<b> Expected Output </b>
<p>Output depends on selected format; see the \c formats specification.

<b> Additional Discussion </b>
<p>The %Dakota examples include a demonstration of using the surfpack
executable with an exported model file.
