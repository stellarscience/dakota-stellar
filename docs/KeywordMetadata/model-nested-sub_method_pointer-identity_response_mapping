Blurb:: Identity mapping of sub-method results to top-level responses

Description::
Specifies that the list of sub-method results (statistics, best
parameters, etc.) should map one-to-one to the list of top-level
nested model responses.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

To use an identity mapping, the number of top-level nested model
responses (primary + secondary responses) must equal the number of
sub-method results. If receiving an error about this, set \c output \c
verbose and re-run the Dakota study to see a list of sub-method
results responses.

The identity map may not be used in conjunction with \ref
model-nested-optional_interface_pointer, nor with an explicit \c
primary_response_mapping or \c secondary_response_mapping.
