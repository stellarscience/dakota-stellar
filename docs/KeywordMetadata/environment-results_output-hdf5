Blurb:: Write results to file in HDF5 format

Description::

When this keyword is present, Dakota will right (some) final
method results to disk in HDF5 format instead of just to the console. 
This is an experimental feature, and the contents and organization of 
the output file is subject to change. The current organization and a
brief explanation of HDF5 is provided in the \ref hdf5_output section
of this manual.

With \c hdf5 selected, the default name of the output file is 
\c dakota_results.h5. This can be changed using the \c results_output_file 
keyword.

Topics:: dakota_output

Examples::

\verbatim

  results_output
      hdf5
      results_output_file 'my_results'  # The .h5 extension will be added
\endverbatim
