Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (a.k.a Evolutionary Algorithm)
Description::
\c moga stands for Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm, which is a
global optimization method that does Pareto optimization for multiple
objectives.  It supports general constraints and a mixture of real and
discrete variables.

<b> Constraints </b>

\c moga can utilize linear constraints using the keywords:
-* linear_inequality_constraint_matrix
-* linear_inequality_lower_bounds
-* linear_inequality_upper_bounds
-* linear_inequality_scale_types
-* linear_inequality_scales
-* linear_equality_constraint_matrix
-* linear_equality_targets
-* linear_equality_scale_types
-* linear_equality_scales

<b> Configuration </b>

The genetic algorithm configurations are:
-# fitness
-# replacement
-# niching
-# convergence
-# postprocessor
-# initialization
-# crossover
-# mutation
-# population size

The steps followed by the algorithm are listed below. The
configurations will effect how the algorithm completes each step.

<b> Stopping Criteria </b>

The \c moga method respects the \c max_iterations and \c
max_function_evaluations method independent controls to provide
integer limits for the maximum number of generations and function
evaluations, respectively.

The algorithm also stops when convergence is reached. This involves
repeated assessment of the algorithm's progress in solving the
problem, until some criterion is met.

The specification for convergence in a moga can either be \c
metric_tracker or can be omitted all together. If omitted, no
convergence algorithm will be used and the algorithm will rely on
stopping criteria only.


<b> Expected Outputs </b>

The \c moga method respects the \c output method independent control
to vary the amount of information presented to the user during
execution.

The final results are written to the Dakota tabular output. Additional
information is also available - see the \c log_file and \c
print_each_pop keywords.

Note that moga and SOGA create additional output files during
execution. "finaldata.dat" is a file that holds the final set of
Pareto optimal solutions after any post-processing is
complete. "discards.dat" holds solutions that were discarded from the
population during the course of evolution.

It can often be useful to plot objective function values from these
files to visually see the Pareto front and ensure that finaldata.dat
solutions dominate discards.dat solutions. The solutions are written
to these output files in the format
"Input1...InputN..Output1...OutputM".

<b>Expected HDF5 Output</b> 

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the 
\ref environment-results_output-hdf5 keyword, this method 
writes the following results to HDF5: 

- \ref hdf5_results-best_params 
- \ref hdf5_results-best_obj_fncs (when \ref responses-objective_functions) are specified) 
- \ref hdf5_results-best_constraints 
- \ref hdf5_results-calibration (when \ref responses-calibration_terms are specified) 

<b> Important Notes </b>

The pool of potential members is the current population and the
current set of offspring.

Choice of fitness assessors is strongly related to the type of
replacement algorithm being used and can have a profound effect on the
solutions selected for the next generation.

If using the fitness types \c layer_rank or \c domination_count, it is
strongly recommended that you use the \c replacement_type \c
below_limit (although the roulette wheel selectors can also be used).

The functionality of the domination_count selector of JEGA v1.0 can
now be achieved using the \c domination_count fitness type and \c
below_limit replacement type.

Theory::
The basic steps of the \c moga algorithm are as follows: 
<ol> 
  <li> Initialize the population
  <li> Evaluate the population (calculate the values of the objective function and constraints for each population member)
  <li> Loop until converged, or stopping criteria reached
  <ol>
    <li> Perform crossover
    <li> Perform mutation
    <li> Evaluate the new population 
    <li> Assess the fitness of each member in the population
    <li> Replace the population with members selected to continue in the next generation
    <li> Apply niche pressure to the population
    <li> Test for convergence
  </ol>
  <li> Perform post processing
</ol>

If moga is used in a hybrid optimization method (which requires one
optimal solution from each individual optimization method to be passed
to the subsequent optimization method as its starting point), the
solution in the Pareto set closest to the "utopia" point is given as
the best solution. This solution is also reported in the %Dakota
output.

This "best" solution in the Pareto set has minimum distance from the
utopia point. The utopia point is defined as the point of extreme
(best) values for each objective function. For example, if the Pareto
front is bounded by (1,100) and (90,2), then (1,2) is the utopia
point. There will be a point in the Pareto set that has minimum
L2-norm distance to this point, for example (10,10) may be such a
point.

If moga is used in a method which may require passing multiple
solutions to the next level (such as the \c surrogate_based_global
method or \c hybrid methods), the \c orthogonal_distance
postprocessor type may be used to specify the distances between each
solution value to winnow down the solutions in the full Pareto front
to a subset which will be passed to the next iteration.
