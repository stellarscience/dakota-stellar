Blurb::
User-customizable portion of exported/imported surrogate model
filenames

Description::

%Dakota surrogate model files are exported and imported using one file
per response, per requested format. The files are named using the
pattern \c {prefix}.{response_descriptor}.{extension}. This \c
filename_prefix keyword is used to supply the prefix portion of the
pattern.

The \c response_descriptor portion of the pattern is filled in using
the response \ref responses-descriptors provided by the user (or, if
none are specified, descriptors automatically generated by
%Dakota). Extension is a three or four letter string that depends on
the format.

Examples::

This input snippet directs %Dakota to write one algebraic format file
and one binary archive file for each response. The names of the files
will follow the patterns \c my_surrogate.{response_descriptor}.alg
(for the algebraic files) and \c
my_surrogate.{response_descriptor}.bsps (for the binary files).
