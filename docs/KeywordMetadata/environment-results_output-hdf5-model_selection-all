Blurb:: Write evaluation data to HDF5 for all models

Description::

When this option is selected, evaluation for all models will 
be written to HDF5.

HDF5 output is an experimental feature, and the contents and organization of 
the output file is subject to change. The current organization and a
brief explanation of HDF5 is provided in the \ref hdf5_output section
of this manual.

Topics:: dakota_output

Examples::

For the example input in the parent keyword, the following model groups would be 
written:

- \c /models/recast/RECAST_surr_RECAST_1/
- \c /models/simulation/truth_m/
- \c /models/surrogate/surr/

The recast model, in this case, is automatically generated by Dakota to handle summing the
pair of objective functions. See \ref hdf5_evaluations-hdf5_eval_sources for further explanation.

The following links would be added to methods and models \c sources groups:
- \c /methods/opt/sources/RECAST_surr_RECAST_1 \f$ \rightarrow \f$ \c /models/recast/RECAST_surr_RECAST_1/
- \c /methods/training/sources/truth_m \f$ \rightarrow \f$ \c /models/simulation/truth_m/
- \c /models/recast/RECAST_surr_RECAST_1/sources/surr \f$ \rightarrow \f$ \c /models/surrogate/surr/

Depending on \ref environment-results_output-hdf5-interface_selection, the following links may also
be added to model \c sources groups:

- \c /models/surrogate/surr/sources/APPROX_INTERFACE_1 \f$ \rightarrow \f$ \c /interfaces/APPROX_INTERFACE_1/surr/
- \c /models/simulation/truth_m/sources/truth \f$ \rightarrow \f$ \c /interfaces/truth/truth_m/
