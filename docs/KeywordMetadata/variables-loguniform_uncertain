Aleatory uncertain variable - loguniform

Description::
If the logarithm of an uncertain variable X has a uniform distribution, that is 
\f$\log X \sim U(L_{LU},U_{LU}),\f$
then X is distributed with a loguniform distribution. The distribution lower bound is \f$L_{LU}\f$ and upper bound is \f$L_{LU}\f$
The loguniform distribution has the density function:
\f[f(x) = \frac{1}{ x \left( \ln(U_{LU}) - \ln(L_{LU}) \right) }\f]

Theory::
For some methods, including vector and centered parameter studies, an
initial point is needed for the uncertain variables. When not given
explicitly, these variables are initialized to their means.
