Complete concurrent evaluation of all evaluations within a batch

Description::
In the \c blocking case, all of the concurrent evaluations in the batch must be completed and all results are returned together to the algorithm.

<!--
- In the specific context of parallel pattern search, if the best of these trial points is an improving point, then it becomes the next iterate.

- In the specific context of adaptive refinement of Gaussian process (GP) models, all look-aheads are replaced with truth data and a new set of refinement candidates can then be generated based on the updated state of the GP.
-->

These runs are reproducible, assuming use of the same seed in cases with random number generation.
