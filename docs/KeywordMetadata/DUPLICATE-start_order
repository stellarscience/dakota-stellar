Blurb::
(Initial) polynomial order of each univariate function within the functional tensor train.

Description::
This specifies the initial polynomial order of each univariate function that makes up the functional tensor train decomposition.  In the case of \c adapt_order, polynomial order starts from this value and is then advanced; its maximum value is limited by \c max_order and increments are controlled by \c kick_order.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

Default is 2.
