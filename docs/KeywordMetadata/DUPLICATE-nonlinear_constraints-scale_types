How to scale each nonlinear constraint

Description::
Each string in \c scale_types indicates the scaling type for each
nonlinear inequality (equality) constraint. They only have effect
when the associated method specifies \c scaling.

The options are:

\li <tt>'value'</tt> - characteristic value by which nonlinear
    constraint values will be divided. If this is chosen, then \ref \c
    scales must also be specified; 'value' is assumed if scales are
    given without \c scale_types

\li <tt>'auto'</tt> - automatic scaling based on bounds (inequalities)
    or targets (equalities)

\li <tt>'log'</tt> - logarithmic scaling (can be used together with \c
    scales, which can be helpfully used to negate values prior to log
    transformation)

If a single string is specified it will apply to all of the nonlinear
inequality (equality) constraints. Otherwise a string must be
specified for each nonlinear inequality (equality) constraint.

<b>Usage Tips:</b>

See the scaling information under specific methods, e.g.,
method-*-scaling for details on how to use this keyword.
