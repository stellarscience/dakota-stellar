Blurb::
Number of optimal designs selected concurrently

Description::
Each iteration of the \c experimental_design algorithm yields \c batch_size
optimal designs. If \c max_hifi is set to zero, these values will merely
be reported in Dakota output and the file \c experimental_design_output.txt.
Otherwise, the high-fidelity model will be run at all optimal designs, and the
responses will be added to the list of experiment data before the Bayesian
calibration is performed in the next iteration of the algorithm.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

By default, optimal designs will be selected one at a time.
