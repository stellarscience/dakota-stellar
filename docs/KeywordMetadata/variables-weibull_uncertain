Aleatory uncertain variable - Weibull

Description::
The Weibull distribution is also referred to as the Type III Smallest Extreme Value distribution.
The Weibull distribution is commonly used in reliability studies to predict the lifetime of a device.  It is also used to model capacity variables such as material strength.

The density function for the Weibull distribution is given by: 
\f[ f(x) = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}
     	   \left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^{\alpha-1}
	   \exp \left( -\left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^{\alpha} \right),
\f]
\f$\mu = \beta \Gamma\left( 1+\frac{1}{\alpha} \right),\f$ and 
\f$\sigma = \mu \sqrt{\frac{\Gamma(1+\frac{2}{\alpha})}{\Gamma^2(1+\frac{1}{\alpha})} - 1} \f$
