Compute diagnostic metrics for Markov chain

Description::
While a Markov chain produced via Monte Carlo sampling eventually converges
to a set of samples representative of an underlying probability distribution,
the first set of samples may not accurately capture the target distribution.
Chain diagnostic metrics provide measures of this convergence, and are intended
to help users decide whether \c samples should be increased in Bayesian
calibration exercises.
