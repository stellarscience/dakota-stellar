Blurb:: Validate/use variable labels from tabular file header

Description::
When importing global surrogate training data (or challenge evaluation
points) from a tabular data file containing a header (\c annotated or
\c custom_annotated \c header), this keyword toggles validation of
variable labels present in the header row.

The labels are validated against the descriptors of the variables
being imported to. If the tabular file labels can be rearranged to
match the expected labels, the columns in the data file will be
reordered on read to match the Dakota variable order. If the read
labels are not a permutation of, nor equal to, the expected labels, an
error will result.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

When not specified, variable labels will be read, but not strictly
enforced or reordered. A warning will be issued if the variable labels
are not as expected, and guidance offered if they can be permuted to
match expectations.

<b> Expected Output </b>

Console output will be generated for any warnings, as well as to
indicate whether any variable reordering is taking place.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

The use of this keyword is recommended when importing header-annotated
tabular data files where the variables are appropriately
labeled. Tabular files do not always contain response labels, so no
attempt is made to disambiguate variable from response labels. The
variable labels must appear contiguously in the header after any
leading column IDs such as 'eval_id' or 'interface'.

This example enforces variable labels for both build and challenge points
\verbatim

  id_model = 'SURR'
  surrogate global
    polynomial quadratic
    import_build_points_file = 'dakota_surrogate_import.unc_fixedothers.dat'
      annotated  use_variable_labels
    challenge_points_file = 'dakota_surrogate_import.dat'
      annotated  use_variable_labels
\endverbatim
