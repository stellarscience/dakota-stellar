Blurb::
Run Python through a direct interface - requires special Dakota build

Description::
%Dakota supports a library-linked interface to Python, but it must be
explicitly enabled when compiling %Dakota from source. Consult the
Users Manual \cite UsersMan for discussion and examples.  Contact the
%Dakota users mailing list for assistance building and using %Dakota
with these interfaces.

The \ref interface-analysis_drivers specifies a Python module:function
which implements the parameter to response mapping.  List data
structures are the default, but NumPy is also supported, if enabled in
the build.
