Blurb:: Stopping criterion based on objective function convergence

Description::
The \c convergence_tolerance specification provides a real value for
controlling the termination of iteration.

For optimization, it is most commonly a <b>relative convergence
tolerance</b> for the objective function; i.e., if the change in the
objective function between successive iterations divided by the
previous objective function is less than the amount specified by
convergence_tolerance, then this convergence criterion is satisfied on
the current iteration.

Therefore, permissible values are between 0 and 1, non-inclusive.

NPSOL defines an internal optimality tolerance which is used in
evaluating if an iterate satisfies the first-order Kuhn-Tucker
conditions for a minimum. The magnitude of \c convergence_tolerance
approximately specifies the number of significant digits of accuracy
desired in the final objective function (e.g., \c
convergence_tolerance = \c 1.0e-6 will result in approximately six
digits of accuracy in the final objective function).
