Blurb::
Manually specify the burn in period for the MCMC chain.

Description::
The burn in period is the number of samples at the beginning of the MCMC chain 
that are discarded. The resulting chain is less dependent on the starting point
of the chain.
 
<b> Default Behavior </b>

If not specified, no MCMC samples are discarded

<b> Expected Output </b>

If \c burn_in_samples is specified, an additional tabular output file containing
the final MCMC chain is generated. 

Examples::
Generate a chain of length 1000 and discard the first 100 points,
resulting in a chain of length 900.
