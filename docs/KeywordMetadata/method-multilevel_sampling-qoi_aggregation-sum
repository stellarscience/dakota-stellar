Blurb:: 
Aggregate the variances over all QoIs to generate a target for each level in a MLMC algorithm. 

Description:: 
The variances of the \c allocation_target of \f$Y^i_\ell, i = 1,...,R\f$ are aggregated and a single sample allocation is computed. 

Topics::

Examples::
The following method block 
\verbatim
method,
	model_pointer = 'HIERARCH'
        multilevel_sampling
	  pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
	  convergence_tolerance = .01
	  allocation_target = mean
      qoi_aggregation = sum
\endverbatim

uses the sum rule to aggregate the variance over the qois.
