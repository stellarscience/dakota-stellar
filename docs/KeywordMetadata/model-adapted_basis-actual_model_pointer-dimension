Prescribe the number of active dimensions 

Description::
If a prescribed dimension for the rotation matrix is desired, this can be specified with the keywork \c dimension. In this case, the algorithm does not use the \c truncation_method or the \c truncation_tolerance to determine the truncation of the rotation matrix, but it just selects the first \f$d\f$ dimensions, where \f$d\f$ is assigned by \c dimension.

Examples::
The following block  

\verbatim
model
  id_model = 'SUBSPACE'
  adapted_basis
    actual_model_pointer = 'FULLSPACE'
    sparse_grid_level = 1	
    dimension = 3	
\endverbatim

prescribes the selection of the first three most important directions to build the rotation matrix and the reduced model representation.
