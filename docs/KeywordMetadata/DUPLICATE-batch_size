Blurb::
The number of evaluation points to include in each batch.

Description::
The number of evaluation points to include in each batch, typically
specified for purposes of concurrent execution of these points.

Topics::	
Examples::
In the context of adaptive surrogate refinement, batch size requests the
generation of multiple refinement candidates that can be evaluated
concurrently.  This may represent a trade-off between algorithmic efficiency
(selecting only the best refinement candidate, one at a time) and scalability
(selecting multiple refinement candidates, of decreasing value, to maintain
a desired concurrency/load balance).
