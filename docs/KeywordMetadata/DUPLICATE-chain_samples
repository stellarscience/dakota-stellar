Number of Markov Chain Monte Carlo posterior samples

Description::
The \c chain_samples keyword indicates the number of draws from the
posterior distribution to perform.  When an emulator is active, this
will be the number of samples on the constructed surrogate model.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

The default number of chain samples is method-dependent.  QUESO and MUQ
methods use 1000.  DREAM uses (number of generations) x (number of
chains), resulting in chain_samples close to that specified.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

MCMC methods typically require a large number of chain samples to
converge, often thousands to millions.
