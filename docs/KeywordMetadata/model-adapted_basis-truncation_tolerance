Convergence tolerance used to identify the (reduced) dimension of the rotation matrix 

Description::
This convergence tolerance controls the dimension of the rotation matrix after the truncation.  
The metric controlled by this convergence tolerance is a quantity varying between [0,1].
If a more aggressive dimension truncation is desired, the default value (0.8) can be reduced to a lower
value.

Examples::
The following block

\verbatim
model
  id_model = 'SUBSPACE'
  adapted_basis
    actual_model_pointer = 'FULLSPACE'
    sparse_grid_level = 1
    truncation_tolerance = 0.9 
\endverbatim

increases the default value (0.8) for the \c truncation_tolerance to 0.9 to obtain a rotation matrix and, consequently, a reduced model that more closely approximates the full dimensional model.
