Blurb:: Multi-point surrogate approximation based on QMEA algorithm

Description::

The Quadratic Multipoint Exponential Approximation (QMEA) builds a
multi-point approximation from values and gradients at multiple
expansion points.  It is a generalization of the two-point exponential
approximation (TPEA).

This capability is \b experimental.
