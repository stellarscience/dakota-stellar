Blurb::
Explicitly specify the desired subspace size

Description::
This control explicitly indicates the number of basis vectors to retain.
The subspace model will include exactly \c dimension variables.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

Active for adapted basis.  Not active for active subspace (the number of basis vectors will be chosen by one of the truncation methods).

<b> Usage Tips </b>

This control can be helpful when \a a \a priori studies give insight to the appropriate
subspace size.
