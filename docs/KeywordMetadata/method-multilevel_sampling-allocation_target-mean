method-multilevel_sampling-allocation_target-mean

Blurb:: 
Fit MLMC sample allocation to control the variance of the estimator for the mean.

Description:: 
Computes the variance of the mean estimator and fits sample allocation by solving the corresponding optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved in analitically closed form.

Topics::

Examples::
The following method block 
\verbatim
method,
	model_pointer = 'HIERARCH'
        multilevel_sampling
	  pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
	  convergence_tolerance = .01
	  allocation_target = mean
\endverbatim

uses the mean as sample allocation target by computing its variance.
