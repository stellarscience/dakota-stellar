Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms from the MUQ package

Description::

The \c muq method supports the following MCMC algorithms: 
adaptive metropolis (AM), Metropolis Hasting (MH), delayed
rejection (DR), or delayed-rejection adaptive metropolis (DRAM). 

The \c muq method is currently an experimental method that relies 
on algorithms from MIT's MUQ code documented at: 
https://bitbucket.org/mituq/muq2/src/master/

We anticipate using more advanced features of MUQ such as Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo and Langevin methods in future releases of Dakota.
