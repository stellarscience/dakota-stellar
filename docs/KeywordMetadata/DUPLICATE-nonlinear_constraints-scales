Characteristic values to scale each nonlinear constraint

Description::

Each real value in \c scales is a nonzero characteristic value to be
used in scaling each nonlinear inequality (equality) constraint. They
only have effect when the associated method specifies \c scaling.

This keyword is required for \c scale_types of <tt>'value'</tt> and
optional for <tt>'log'</tt>. When specified in conjunction with log,
scale values are applied prior to the logarithm, to permit log scaling
of strictly negative response functions.

If a single scale value is specified it will apply to all of the
nonlinear inequality (equality) constraints. Otherwise a value must
be specified for each nonlinear inequality (equality) constraint.

<b>Usage Tips:</b>

When \c scales are specified, but not \c scale_types, the scaling type
is assumed to be 'value' for this set of nonlinear inequality
(equality) constraints.

Use scale values of 1.0 to selectively avoid scaling a subset of
response functions.

See the scaling information under specific methods, e.g.,
method-*-scaling for details on how to use this keyword.
