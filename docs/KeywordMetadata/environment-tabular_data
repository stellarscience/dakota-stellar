Blurb:: Write a tabular results file with variable and response history

Description::
Specifying the \c tabular_data flag writes to a data file the same
variable and response function history data plotted when using the
(deprecated) \c graphics flag.  Within the generated data file, the
variables and response functions appear as columns and each function
evaluation provides a new table row. This capability is most useful
for post-processing of %Dakota results with third-party graphics tools
such as MatLab, Excel, Tecplot, etc.

There is no dependence between the \c graphics flag and the \c
tabular_data flag; they may be used independently or
concurrently.

Dakota exports tabular data in one of three formats:
\li \c annotated (default)
\li \c custom_annotated
\li \c freeform
