Blurb:: CONMIN method of feasible directions

Description::
The interpretations of the method independent controls for CONMIN are
essentially identical to those for DOT.  

See \ref topic-package_dot for information related to \c CONMIN
methods, specifically \ref method-dot_mmfd.

<b>Expected HDF5 Output</b> 

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the 
\ref environment-results_output-hdf5 keyword, this method 
writes the following results to HDF5: 

- \ref hdf5_results-best_params 
- \ref hdf5_results-best_obj_fncs (when \ref responses-objective_functions) are specified) 
- \ref hdf5_results-best_constraints 
- \ref hdf5_results-calibration (when \ref responses-calibration_terms are specified)
