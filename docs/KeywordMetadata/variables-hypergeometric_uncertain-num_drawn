Distribution parameter for the hypergeometric distribution describing the number of draws from a combined population
Description::

The density function for the hypergeometric distribution is given by: 
\f[f(x) = \frac{\left(\begin{array}{c}m\\x\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}{N-m}\\{n-x}\end{array}\right)}{\left(\begin{array}{c}N\\n\end{array}\right)}\f] 
where the three distribution parameters are:
- N is the total population
- m is the number of items in the selected population (e.g. the number of white balls in the full urn of N items)
- <em>n is the size of the sample drawn</em> (e.g. number of balls drawn)

In addition,
- x, the abscissa of the density function, indicates the number of successes (e.g. drawing a white ball)
- \f$\left(\begin{array}{c}a\\b\end{array}\right)\f$ indicates a binomial coefficient ("a choose b")
