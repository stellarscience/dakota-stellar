Blurb:: Solution mode for multilevel/multifidelity methods

Description:: Multilevel / multifidelity sampling methods are adaptive
UQ methods that utilize a pilot sample to estimate an initial set of
correlations or variances, and then augment the pilot with additional
sample increments to optimally allocate resources.  The pilot sample
can be integrated according to one of three solution modes:
\li \c online_pilot: include pilot sample cost within sample allocation (default)
\li \c offline_pilot: treat pilot cost as offline and exclude from sample allocation
\li \c pilot_projection: only perform the pilot sample and only estimate the expected performance based on a projection of the pilot statistics (useful for method selection)
