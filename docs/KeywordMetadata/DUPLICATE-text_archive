Surrogate model plain-text archive file format

Description::
When specified, the surrogate model will be exported (or imported)
using a plain-text archive format.

Experimental surrogates will export to (import from) text archives
named \c {prefix}.{response_descriptor}.txt.

Other (Surfpack) surrogates will export/import using files named 
\c {prefix}.{response_descriptor}.sps, in which
'sps' stands for Surfpack surrogate.

See \c filename_prefix for further information about surrogate file
naming.
