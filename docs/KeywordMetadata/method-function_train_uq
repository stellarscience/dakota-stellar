Blurb::
UQ method leveraging a functional tensor train surrogate model.

Description::
Tensor train decompositions are approximations that exploit low rank structure
in an input-output mapping.  Refer to the \c function_train surrogate model
for additional details.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

This method is mostly a generic UQ shell for the \c function_train
surrogate model.  Rank controls and other function train specifics are
managed in the model specification.

Examples::
\verbatim

	function_train_uq
	  samples_on_emulator = 100000
	  variance_based_decomp
	model_pointer = 'FT'
\endverbatim
