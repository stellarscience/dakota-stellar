Method used to build the rotation matrix

Description::
The rotation matrix for the Adapted Basis method is built starting from a matrix which includes the linear PCE coefficients. The entries of the first row are the linear PCE coefficients. For all the other rows, each row has only one nonzero entry. Depending on the way used to construct all the rows, from the second to last one, there are two implemented methods, \ref model-adapted_basis-actual_model_pointer-rotation_method-unranked and \ref model-adapted_basis-actual_model_pointer-rotation_method-ranked. A followed Gram_schmidt process is applied on the resulting matrix to make it an isometry.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

The default is to use the \ref
model-adapted_basis-actual_model_pointer-rotation_method-ranked.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

Examples::
The following method block 

\verbatim
model
  id_model = 'SUBSPACE'
  adapted_basis
    actual_model_pointer = 'FULLSPACE'
    sparse_grid_level = 1	
    rotation_method = unranked  
\endverbatim

changes the default method to the \ref model-adapted_basis-actual_model_pointer-rotation_method-unranked method.
