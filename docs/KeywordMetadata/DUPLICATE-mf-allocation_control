Blurb:: Sample allocation approach for multifidelity polynomial chaos and multifidelity stochastic collocation

Description::

Multifidelity polynomial chaos and multifidelity stochastic
collocation can optionally employ a greedy sample allocation strategy,
where adaptive refinement spans multiple level candidates.  The
default, when \c allocation_control is not specified, is to compute or
adapt separately for each model fidelity.
