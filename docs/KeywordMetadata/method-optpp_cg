Blurb::
A conjugate gradient optimization method
Description::
The conjugate gradient method is an implementation of the
Polak-Ribiere approach and handles only unconstrained problems.

See \ref topic-package_optpp for info related to all \c optpp methods.

<b>Expected HDF5 Output</b>

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the 
\ref environment-results_output-hdf5 keyword, this method
writes the following results to HDF5:

- \ref hdf5_results-best_params
- \ref hdf5_results-best_obj_fncs (when \ref responses-objective_functions) are specified)
- \ref hdf5_results-calibration (when \ref responses-calibration_terms are specified)
