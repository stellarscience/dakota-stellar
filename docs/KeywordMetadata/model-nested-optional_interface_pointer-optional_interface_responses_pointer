Pointer to responses block that defines non-nested responses
Description::
\c optional_interface_responses_pointer points to the reponses block (specifically, 
its \ref responses-id_responses label) that defines the non-nested response to return
to the nested model. The \c primary_response_mapping keywords control how these 
non-nested respones are combined with responses from the nested sub-iterator. See the
entry for \c optional_interface_pointer for a full description. If 
\c optional_interface_responses_pointer is not provided, the top-level.
responses specification is reused.
