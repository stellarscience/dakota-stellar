Blurb:: Top-level settings for %Dakota execution
Description::

The environment section in a %Dakota input file is optional.  It
specifies the top-level solution environment, optionally including run
modes, output controls, and identification of the primary iterative
method (\c top_method_pointer).  The output-related keywords address
generation of tabular and results data, and precision of
numerical output.

<b> Run Mode Defaults </b> 

Dakota run phases include \c check, \c pre_run, \c run, and \c
post_run.  The default behavior is to \c pre_run, \c run, and \c
post_run, though any or all of these may be specified to select
specific run phases.  Specifying \c check will cause Dakota to exit
before any selected run modes.
