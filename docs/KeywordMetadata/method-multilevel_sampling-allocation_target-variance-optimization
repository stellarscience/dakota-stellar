method-multilevel_sampling-allocation_target-variance-optimization

Blurb:: 
Solve the optimization problem for the sample allocation by numerical optimization in the case of sampling estimator targeting the variance.

Description:: 
Employ numerical optimization to solve the optimization problem for finding the optimal sample allocation when targeting the variance. This option needs NPSOL (preferred choice) or OPTPP (alternative choice) installed.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

Examples::
The following method block 
\verbatim
method,
	model_pointer = 'HIERARCH'
        multilevel_sampling
	  pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
	  convergence_tolerance = .01
	  allocation_target = variance
	  	optimization
\endverbatim

uses the variance as sample allocation target and solves the resulting optimization problem using numerical optimization.
