Do not require strict cache equality when finding duplicates

Description::
By default, Dakota's evaluation cache and restart capabilities are
based on strict binary equality. This provides a performance
advantage, as it permits a hash-based data structure to be used to
search the evaluation cache. However, deactiving strict equality may
prevent cache misses, which can occur when attempting to use a restart
file on a machine different from the one on which it was generated.
