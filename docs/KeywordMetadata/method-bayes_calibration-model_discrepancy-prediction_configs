Blurb::
List prediction locations for model discrepancy

Description::
Following the calculation of the model discrepancy functions, \f$\delta_i\f$, 
and the corrected model \f$M_i + \delta_i\f$ may be calculated at new or 
"prediction" configurations. Using the \c prediction_configs command, the 
user may explicitly list the locations of the prediction configurations they 
wish to be computed. See parent command for an example. 

<b> Usage Tips </b>

If none of \c num_prediction_configs, \c prediction_configs, or
\c import_prediction_configs is specified, the number of prediction 
configurations is set to 10 for scalar responses. For field responses, the
corrected model will be output at the input values of the configuration 
variables.
