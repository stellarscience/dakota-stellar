Blurb::
Number of simulation samples to estimate the PCE coefficients

Description::
In this case, the expansion order p cannot be inferred from the
numerical integration specification and it is necessary to provide an
expansion_order to specify p for a total-order expansion.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

For most use cases, this keyword will specify a single integer number
of samples.  In more advanced UQ studies with hierarchical models, the
list of integers can apply to different models and/or model levels
