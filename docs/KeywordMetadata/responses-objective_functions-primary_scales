Characteristic values to scale each objective function

Description::
Each real value in \c primary_scales is a nonzero characteristic value
to be used in scaling each objective function. They only have effect
when the associated method specifies \c scaling.

This keyword is required for \ref
responses-objective_functions-primary_scale_types of <tt>'value'</tt> and
optional for <tt>'log'</tt>. When specified in conjunction with log,
scale values are applied prior to the logarithm, to permit log scaling
of strictly negative response functions.

Length: When specified, \c primary_scales must have length one of:

\li One (the single value will be applied to each objective function); or

\li Number of response groups (\ref responses-objective_functions), so
the number of scalars plus the number of fields when fields are
present; or

\li Total number of response elements, so the number of scalar
responses plus the sum of the lengths of the fields.

<b>Usage Tips:</b>

When \c primary_scales are specified, but not \ref
responses-objective_functions-primary_scale_types, the scaling type is assumed
to be 'value' for all primary response functions.

Use scale values of 1.0 to selectively avoid scaling a subset of
response functions.

When scaling is active, it is applied to objective functions prior to
any \ref responses-objective_functions-weights and multi-objective sum
formation. See the equations in \ref responses-objective_functions.

See the scaling information under specific methods, e.g.,
\c method-*-scaling for details on how to use this keyword.
