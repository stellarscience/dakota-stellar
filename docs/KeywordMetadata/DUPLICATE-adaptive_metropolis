Blurb::  Use the Adaptive Metropolis MCMC algorithm

Description::  
This keyword specifies the use of the Adaptive Metropolis algorithm.
That is, the "AM" part of DRAM is used but the "DR" part is not:
specifying this keyword activates only the Adaptive Metropolis part of
the MCMC algorithm, in which the covariance of the proposal density is
updated adaptively.
 
<b> Default Behavior </b>

Five MCMC algorithm variants are supported in QUESO: \c dram, \c
delayed_rejection, \c adaptive_metropolis, \c metropolis_hastings, and
\c multilevel.  The default is \c dram.

Four MCMC variants are currently supported in MUQ: \c dram, \c
delayed_rejection, \c metropolis_hastings and \c adaptive_metropolis.  

<b> Usage Tips </b>

If the user knows very little about the proposal covariance, but
doesn't want to incur the cost of using full dram with both delayed
rejection and adaptive metropolis, specifying only \c
adaptive_metropolis offers a good strategy.
