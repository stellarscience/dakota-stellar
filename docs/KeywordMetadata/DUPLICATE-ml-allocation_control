Blurb:: Sample allocation approach for multilevel polynomial chaos

Description:: 
Multilevel polynomial chaos requires a sample allocation strategy.  Three options are currently available:

- greedy refinement (sparse grids, tensor grids, regression)
- allocation based on assuming a convergence rate for the estimator variance (for regression only)
- restricted isometry property (RIP) (for compressed sensing only)

The greedy approach is generally preferred over assuming a convergence rate for the estimator variance or allocating samples based on the restricted isometry property (RIP) for compressed sensing.
