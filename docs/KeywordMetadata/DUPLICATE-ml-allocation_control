Blurb:: Sample allocation approach for multilevel expansions

Description:: 
Multilevel expansions, including regression-based polynomial chaos expansion
(PCE) and function train (FT) expansions, require a sample allocation strategy.
Three options are currently available:

- allocation based on assuming a convergence rate for the estimator variance (for regression PCE)
- restricted isometry property (RIP) sampling (for regression PCE via compressed sensing)
- rank sampling (for FT)

<b> Default Behavior </b>

Current defaults, when \c allocation_control is not specified, are
estimator variance for PCE and rank sampling for FT.
