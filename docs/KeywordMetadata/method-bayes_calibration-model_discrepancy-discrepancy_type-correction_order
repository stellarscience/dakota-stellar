Trend function order of the model discrepancy

Description::
Whether Gaussian process or polynomial regression model is selected as
the discrepancy formulation, the order of the trend function may be specified 
using the \c correction_order command followed by either \c constant, 
\c linear, or \c quadratic.

Note that for Dakota 6.8 and earlier, this keyword only applies to discrepancy 
calculations for scalar responses. For field responses, a Gaussian process
model with a quadratic function is used by default.
