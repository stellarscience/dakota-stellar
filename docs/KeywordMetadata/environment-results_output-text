Blurb:: Write results to file in text format

Description::

When this keyword is present, Dakota will right (some) final
method results to disk in a custom structured text format instead 
of just to the console. Support for text format results output 
will be deprecated in a future release, and the contents and 
organization of the output file is subject to change.

The default name of the file is \c dakota_results.txt. This can
be changed using the \c results_output_file keyword.
