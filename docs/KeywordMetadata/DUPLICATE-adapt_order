Blurb::
Activate adaptive procedure for determining the best basis order

Description:: This option activates a cross validation procedure to
select the best basis order for representing the current set of data.
It searches from \c start_order to \c max_order in increments of
\c kick_order.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

No cross validation for basis order.

Topics::

Examples::
This example shows specification of an order adaptation starting at order 2,
incrementing by 2, and limited at order 6.
\verbatim
model,
	id_model = 'FT'
	surrogate global function_train
	  start_rank = 4
	  adapt_order  start_order = 2  kick_order = 2  max_order = 6
	  solver_tolerance   = 1e-12
	  rounding_tolerance = 1e-12
	dace_method_pointer = 'SAMPLING'
\endverbatim

Note that \c adapt_rank and \c adapt_order can either be combined or
used separately.
