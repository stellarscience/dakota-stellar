Number of function evaluations allowed for optimizers

Description::
The maximum number of function evaluations is used as a stopping
criterion for optimizers.  If it has not reached any other stopping
criteria first, the optimizer will stop after it has performed \c
max_function_evalutions evaluations.  See also \c max_iterations.

Some optimizers (e.g. \c ncsu_direct) may run past this limit in the course
of an iteration step that began before \c max_function_evaluations was 
exceeded.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

Default value is 1000.
