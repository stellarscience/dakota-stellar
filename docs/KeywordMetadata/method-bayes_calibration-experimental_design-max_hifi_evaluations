Blurb::
Maximum number of high-fidelity model runs to be used

Description::
There are three stopping criteria by which the Bayesian experimental design
algorithm will be terminated:
\li The high-fidelity model has been run \c max_hifi_evaluations times
\li The set of candidate design points have been exhausted
\li The relative change in the mutual information from one iteration to the
next is sufficiently small
The first criterion is controlled by this keyword specification

<b> Default Behavior </b>

If no maximum number of high-fidelity model runs is specified, only the last
two stopping criteria listed above will be evaluated.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

Be wary that \c max_hifi_evaluations does not include any high-fidelity model
evaluations that need to be run to produce the data set for the initial 
Bayesian calibration. This number only includes those evaluations performed
on the sequentially chosen optimal design points

If \c max_hifi_evaluations is set to zero, the a single optimal experimental 
design point will be selected, and Dakota will exit without running the high-
fidelity model.
