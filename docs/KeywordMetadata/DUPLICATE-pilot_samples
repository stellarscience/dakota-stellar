Blurb:: Initial set of samples for multilevel sampling methods.

Description:: The pilot sample provides initial estimates of variance and/or
correlation within the first iteration of a multilevel and/or control variate
approach.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

100 samples per model fidelity and/or discretization level.

<!-- <b> Expected Output </b> -->

<b> Usage Tips </b>

The number of specified values can be none (default values used for
all fidelities and levels), one (all fidelities and levels use the
same specified value), the number of discretization levels for every
model (each model uses the same discretization level profile), or the
aggregate number of discretization levels for all models (samples for
each discretization level are distinct for each model).
