Blurb:: 
Compute sample allocation for each response and use maximum over responses for each level in a MLMC algorithm

Description:: 
An individual sample allocation for each response using the respective variances of the \c allocation_target of \f$Y^i_\ell\f$ over all levels is computed; the maximum over all responses for each level is taken.

Examples::
The following method block 
\verbatim
method,
	model_pointer = 'HIERARCH'
        multilevel_sampling
	  pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
	  convergence_tolerance = .01
	  allocation_target = mean
      qoi_aggregation = max
\endverbatim

uses the max rule to aggregate the variance over the qois.
