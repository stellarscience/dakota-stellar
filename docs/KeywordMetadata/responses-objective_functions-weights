Specify weights for each objective function

Description::

For multi-objective optimization problems (where the number of
objective functions is greater than 1), then a \c weights
specification provides a simple weighted-sum approach to combining
multiple objectives into a single objective: \f[f = \sum_{i=1}^{n}
w_{i}f_{i}\f]

Length: The \c weights must have length equal to \ref
responses-objective_functions. Thus, when scalar and/or field
responses are specified, the number of \c weights must equal the
number of scalars plus the number of fields, \e not the total elements
in the fields.

<b>Default Behavior</b> If weights are not specified, then each
response is given equal weighting: \f[f = \sum_{i=1}^{n}
\frac{f_i}{n}\f] where, in both of these cases, a "minimization" \ref
responses-objective_functions-sense will retain a positive weighting
for a minimizer and a "maximization" sense will apply a negative
weighting.

<b>Usage Tips:</b>

Weights are applied as multipliers, scales as charateristic values /
divisors.

When scaling is active, it is applied to objective functions prior to
any \c weights and multi-objective sum formation. See the equations in
\ref responses-objective_functions.
