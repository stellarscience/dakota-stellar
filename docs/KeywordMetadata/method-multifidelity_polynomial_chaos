Blurb:: Multifidelity uncertainty quantification using polynomial chaos expansions

Description:: 
As described in \ref method-polynomial_chaos, the polynomial chaos 
expansion (PCE) is a general framework for the approximate representation 
of random response functions in terms of series expansions in standardized 
random variables:

\f[R = \sum_{i=0}^P \alpha_i \Psi_i(\xi) \f]

where \f$\alpha_i\f$ is a deterministic coefficient, \f$\Psi_i\f$ is a
multidimensional orthogonal polynomial and \f$\xi\f$ is a vector of
standardized random variables. 

In the multilevel and multifidelity cases, we decompose this expansion
into several constituent expansions, one per model form or solution
control level.  In a bi-fidelity case with low-fidelity (LF) and
high-fidelity (HF) models and an additive discrepancy approach, we have:

\f[R = \sum_{i=0}^{P^{LF}} \alpha^{LF}_i \Psi_i(\xi)
     + \sum_{i=0}^{P^{HF}}      \delta_i \Psi_i(\xi) \f]

where \f$\delta_i\f$ is a coefficient for the discrepancy expansion.

The same specification options are available as described in 
\ref method-polynomial_chaos with one key difference: many of the
coefficient estimation inputs change from a scalar input for a single
expansion to a <i>sequence</i> specification for a low-fidelity expansion
followed by multiple discrepancy expansions.

To obtain the coefficients \f$\alpha_i\f$ and \f$\delta_i\f$ for each of 
the expansions, the following options are provided:

<ol>
<li> multidimensional integration by a tensor-product of Gaussian
     quadrature rules (specified with \c quadrature_order_sequence, and,
     optionally, \c dimension_preference).
<li> multidimensional integration by the Smolyak sparse grid method
     (specified with \c sparse_grid_level_sequence and, optionally, 
     \c dimension_preference)
<li> multidimensional integration by Latin hypercube sampling (specified 
     with \c expansion_order_sequence and \c expansion_samples_sequence).
<li> linear regression (specified with \c expansion_order_sequence and 
     either \c collocation_points_sequence or \c collocation_ratio), using 
     either over-determined (least squares) or under-determined (compressed 
     sensing) approaches.
<li> orthogonal least interpolation (specified with 
     \c orthogonal_least_interpolation and \c collocation_points_sequence)
<!-- NOT SUPPORTED AT THIS TIME:
<li> multidimensional integration by Stroud cubature rules 
     and extensions as specified with \c cubature_integrand.
<li> coefficient import from a file (specified with \c
     import_expansion_file). The expansion can be comprised of a 
     general set of expansion terms, as indicated by the multi-index 
     annotation within the file.
-->
</ol>

It is important to note that, while \c quadrature_order_sequence, \c
sparse_grid_level_sequence, \c expansion_order_sequence, \c
expansion_samples_sequence, and \c collocation_points_sequence are
array inputs, only one scalar from these arrays is active at a time
for a particular expansion estimation.  In order to specify anisotropy
in resolution across the random variable set, a \c dimension_preference 
specification can be used to augment scalar specifications for
quadrature order, sparse grid level, and expansion order.

Multifidelity UQ using PCE requires that the model selected for
iteration by the method specification is a multifidelity surrogate
model (see \ref model-surrogate-hierarchical), which defines an
\c ordered_model_sequence (see \ref model-surrogate-hierarchical).
Two types of hierarchies are supported: (i) a hierarchy of model forms
composed from more than one model within the \c ordered_model_sequence,
or (ii) a hierarchy of discretization levels comprised from a single
model within the \c ordered_model_sequence which in turn specifies a 
\c solution_level_control (see 
\ref model-single-solution_level_cost-solution_level_control).

In both cases, an expansion will first be formed for the low fidelity
model or coarse discretization, using the first value within the
coefficient estimation sequence, along with any specified refinement
strategy.  Second, expansions are formed for one or more model
discrepancies (the difference between response results if \c additive
\c correction or the ratio of results if \c multiplicative \c
correction), using all subsequent values in the coefficient estimation
sequence (if the sequence does not provide a new value, then the
previous value is reused) along with any specified refinement
strategy.  The number of discrepancy expansions is determined by the
number of model forms or discretization levels in the hierarchy.

After formation and refinement of the constituent expansions, each of
the expansions is combined (added or multiplied) into an expansion
that approximates the high fidelity model, from which the final set of
statistics are generated. For polynomial chaos expansions, this high
fidelity expansion can differ significantly in form from the low
fidelity and discrepancy expansions, particularly in the \c
multiplicative case where it is expanded to include all of the basis
products.
