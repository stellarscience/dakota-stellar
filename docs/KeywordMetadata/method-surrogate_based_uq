Blurb:: Generic UQ method for constructing and interrogating a surrogate model.

Description::
As surrogate models by stochastic expansion migrate into the model specification,
this method provides a general-purpose UQ method to interrogate the surrogate for
generating statistics.

This method must identify the surrogate of interest through its \c model_pointer,
distinguishing it from fully-integrated method specifications such as
\ref method-polynomial_chaos, \ref method-stoch_collocation, and
\ref method-function_train that couple directly with a simulation model
(and form the PCE, SC, FT surrogate approximations implicitly prior to using
them for generating statistics).
