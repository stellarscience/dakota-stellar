Blurb::
Global surrogate model based on functional tensor train decomposition

Description::
Tensor train decompositions are approximations that exploit low rank structure
in an input-output mapping.  In the current implementation, orthogonal
polynomial basis functions are employed as the basis functions, although the
C3 library will enable additional options in the future.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

This new capability is under active development.  It is not included
in the Dakota build by default, as some C3 library dependencies can
induce small differences in our regression suite.

This capability is also being used as a prototype to explore
model-based versus method-based specification of stochastic
expansions.  While the model specification is stand-alone, it
currently requires a corresponding method specification to exercise
the model, which can be either a \c function_train_uq method
specification or more generic UQ strategy such as a \c sampling
method.  The intent is to migrate function train, polynomial chaos,
and stochastic collocation toward model-only specifications that can
then be employed in any surrogate/emulator context.

\verbatim
model,
	id_model = 'FT'
	surrogate global function_train
	  max_order = 5
	  start_rank = 2  kick_rank = 2  max_rank = 10
	  adapt_rank
	dace_method_pointer = 'SAMPLING'
