Blurb::
Maximum polynomial order of each univariate function within the functional tensor train.

Description::
This specification is inactive for curren adaptation options.

In future adaptation options (i.e., cross-approximation adaptation), this will specify the maximum order that can be obtained during adaptation, where polynomial order will start from \c start_order and be limited by \c max_order.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

Max order is unbounded (adaptive sweep will stop when CV error increases).
