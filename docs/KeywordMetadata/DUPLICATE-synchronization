Select how Dakota schedules a batch of concurrent function evaluations in a parallel algorithm

Description::
The \c synchronization specification can be used to specify
the use of either \c blocking or \c nonblocking schedulers, where the
former must block until all evaluations are completed and the latter
does not block, returning only the partial set that has been completed
for a particular call to the scheduler.
