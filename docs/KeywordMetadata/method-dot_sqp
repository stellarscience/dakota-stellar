Blurb:: DOT Sequential Quadratic Program

Description::
DOT library \cite Van95 implementation of sequential quadratic
programming for constrained optimizaiton.

See \ref topic-package_dot for information common to all \c DOT methods.

<em>DOT requires a separate software license and therefore may not
be available in all versions of Dakota.  CONMIN or OPT++ methods may
be suitable alternatives.</em>

<b>Expected HDF5 Output</b> 

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the 
\ref environment-results_output-hdf5 keyword, this method 
writes the following results to HDF5: 

- \ref hdf5_results-best_params 
- \ref hdf5_results-best_obj_fncs (when \ref responses-objective_functions) are specified) 
- \ref hdf5_results-best_constraints 
- \ref hdf5_results-calibration (when \ref responses-calibration_terms are specified)
