Blurb::
Specify a sub-sampling of the MCMC chain

Description::
If a \c sub_sampling_period is specified, the MCMC chain is filtered such that 
only the sample at the beginning of each period is in the final MCMC chain. 
The \c sub_sampling_period should therefore be greater than or equal to the 
correlation length of the samples.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

If not specified, all MCMC samples are included in the final chain.

<b> Expected Output </b>

If specified, an additional tabular output file containing the final (sub-
sampled) MCMC chain is generated.

Examples::
Generate and then filter a 1000 sample MCMC chain, retainining the
first accepted sample and every 100th sample thereafter.

An example method block of a Dakota input file is given below

\verbatim
method,
	bayes_calibration queso
	  chain_samples = 1000 seed = 348
	  dram
	proposal_covariance
	  diagonal values 1.0e6 1.0e-1
	sub_sampling_period 100
\endverbatim
