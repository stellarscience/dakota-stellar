Blurb:: Multilevel methods for sampling-based UQ

Description:: A nascent sampling method that utilizes both multifidelity and
multilevel relationships within a hierarchical surrogate model in order to
improve convergence behavior in sampling methods.   

In the case of a multilevel relationship, multilevel Monte Carlo
methods are used to compute an optimal sample allocation per level,
and in the case of a multifidelity relationship, control variate Monte
Carlo methods are used to compute an optimal sample allocation per
fidelity.  These two approaches can also be combined, resulting in the
three approaches below.

<b> Multilevel Monte Carlo </b>

The Monte Carlo estimator for the mean is defined as
\f[ \mathbb{E}[Q] \equiv \hat{Q}^{MC} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N Q^{(i)} \f]

In a multilevel method with \f$L\f$ levels, we replace this estimator
with a telescoping sum:
\f[ \mathbb{E}[Q] \equiv \hat{Q}^{ML}
 = \sum_{l=0}^L \frac{1}{N_l} \sum_{i=1}^{N_l} (Q_l^{(i)} - Q_{l-1}^{(i)}) 
 \equiv \sum_{l=0}^L \hat{Y}^{MC}_l \f]

This decomposition forms discrepancies for each level greater than 0,
seeking reduction in the variance of the discrepancy \f$Y\f$ relative
to the variance of the original response \f$Q\f$.  The number of samples
allocated for each level (\f$N_l\f$) is based on a total cost minimization
procedure that incorporates the relative cost and observed variance for each 
of the \f$Y_\ell\f$.

<b> Control Variate Monte Carlo </b>

In the case of two model fidelities (low fidelity denoted as LF and
high fidelity denoted as HF), we employ a control variate approach:

\f[ \hat{Q}_{HF}^{CV} = \hat{Q}_{HF}^{MC}
- \beta (\hat{Q}_{LF}^{MC} - \mathbb{E}[Q_{LF}]) \f]

As opposed to the traditional control variate approach, we do not know
\f$\mathbb{E}[Q_{LF}]\f$ precisely, but rather estimate it more
accurately than \f$\hat{Q}_{LF}^{MC}\f$ based on a sampling increment
applied to the LF model.  This sampling increment is based again on
a total cost minimization procedure that incorporates the relative LF
and HF costs and the observed Pearson correlation coefficient
\f$\rho_{LH}\f$ between \f$Q_{LF}\f$ and \f$Q_{HF}\f$.  The
coefficient \f$\beta\f$ is then determined from the observed LF-HF
covariance and LF variance.

<b> Multilevel Control Variate Monte Carlo </b>

If both multifidelity and multilevel structure
are included within the hierarchical model specification, then a control
variate can be applied across fidelities for each level within an
outer multilevel approach.

On each level a control variate is active for the discrepancy \f$Y_{\ell}\f$
based on
\f[ Y_{\ell}^\star = Y_{\ell} + \alpha_\ell \left( \hat{Y}^{\mathrm{LF}}_\ell - \mathbb{E}\left[ Y^{\mathrm{LF}}_\ell \right] \right), \f]
where \f$Y^{\mathrm{LF}}_\ell = \gamma_\ell Q^{\mathrm{LF}}_\ell - Q^{\mathrm{HF}}_\ell\f$.

The optimal parameter \f$\gamma_\ell\f$ is computed from the correlation properties 
between model forms and discretization levels (see the theory manual for further details) 
and the optimal allocation \f$N_\ell\f$ (per level) is finally obtained from it. 

<b> Default Behavior </b> 

The multilevel sampling method employs Monte Carlo sampling be
default, but this default can be overridden to use Latin hypercube
sampling using \c sample_type \c lhs.

<b> Expected Output </b> 

The multilevel sampling method reports estimates of the first four
moments and a summary of the evaluations performed for each model
fidelity and discretization level.  The method does not support any
level mappings (response, probability, reliability, generalized
reliability) at this time.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

The multilevel sampling method must be used in combination with a
hierarchical model specification.  When exploiting multiple
discretization levels, it is necessary to identify the variable string
identifier that controls these levels using \c solution_level_control.
Associated relative costs also need to be supplied using \c
solution_level_cost.

Examples::
The following method block 
\verbatim
method,
	model_pointer = 'HIERARCH'
	multilevel_sampling				
	  pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
	  max_iterations = 10
	  convergence_tolerance = .001
\endverbatim

results in multilevel Monte Carlo when the HIERARCH model
specification contains a single model fidelity with multiple discretization
levels, in control variate Monte Carlo when the HIERARCH model
specification has multiple ordered model fidelities each with a single
discretization level, and multilevel control variate Monte Carlo when
the HIERARCH model specification contains multiple model fidelities
each with multiple discretization levels.

An example of the former (single model fidelity with multiple discretization
levels) follows:
\verbatim
model,
	id_model = 'HIERARCH'
	surrogate hierarchical
	  ordered_model_fidelities = 'SIM1'
	  correction additive zeroth_order

model,
	id_model = 'SIM1'
	simulation
	  solution_level_control = 'N_x'
	  solution_level_cost = 630. 1260. 2100. 4200.
\endverbatim
