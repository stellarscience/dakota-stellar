Blurb:: (Experimental) Write a summary file containing the final results

Description::
(Experimental)

%Dakota writes final results for most methods to the screen (console).
This keyword enables experimental support for writing them to disk, as well.
By default, they are written in a structured text format to a file named
\c dakota_results.txt. Text format can be explicitly selected using the \c text
sub-keyword. If Dakota was built with \c HDF5 enabled, the sub-keyword
\c hdf5 causes results to be written in HDF5 format, as well. 

The name of the results file can be changed using the \c results_output_file
keyword.

Text output eventually will be deprecated, and HDF5 will be enabled in all
distributed builds of Dakota. The layout of the HDF5 file is described in
the \ref hdf5_output section of this manual. The contents, organization, and 
format of results files are all under active development and are subject to change.
