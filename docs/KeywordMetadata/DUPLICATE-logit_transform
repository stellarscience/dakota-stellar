Blurb::Utilize the logit transformation to reduce sample rejection for bounded domains

Description::The logit transformation performs an internal variable transformation from bounded domains to unbounded domains in order to reduce sample rejection due to an out-of-bounds condition.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

This option is experimental at present, and is therefore defaulted off.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

This option can be helpful when regions of high posterior density exist
in the corners of a multi-dimensional bounded domain.  In these cases,
it may be difficult to generate feasible samples from the proposal density,
such that transformation to unbounded domains may greatly reduce sample
rejection rates.
