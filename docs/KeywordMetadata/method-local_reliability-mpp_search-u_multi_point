Blurb:: MPP search for local reliability based on QMEA multi-point approximation in x-space

Description::

Local reliability methods that search for the most probable point
of failure (MPP) may use a surrogate-based optimization procedure.
The \c u_multi_point surrogate option creates a QMEA approximation
in the transformed probability space ("u-space") from accumulating
data from multiple expansion points.

This capability is \b experimental.
